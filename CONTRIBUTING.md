# Contributions Guide

## Introduction

Welcome! We appreciate your interest in contributing to the `jobhunter` project. This document provides a step-by-step guide to help you contribute effectively.

## Looking for Issues

1. **Selecting an Issue**: Begin by looking through open issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted`. 
   - [Open Issues](https://github.com/espin086/jobhunter/issues)
   
2. **Understand Issue Details**: Carefully read the issue description and any associated comments to understand what is expected.

3. **Claim an Issue**: To work on an issue, leave a comment expressing your interest, assign yourself the issue. This prevents multiple contributors from working on the same issue simultaneously.

## Working on the Issue

1. **Create a Branch from the Issue**: Create a branch from the issue and then create a branch, you can do this in the UI. 

2. **Checkout branch locally**: 

    ```
    git fetch origin
    git checkout -b issue_number-brief-description
    ```

3. **Work on the Issue**: Make the necessary code changes to resolve the issue.

4. **Create Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for your code contributions and ensure they pass.


5. **Commit and Push Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message, and push them to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Fixed issue_number: brief description"
    git push origin issue_number-brief-description
    ```

## Submitting Pull Request

1. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the jobhunter repository and create a new pull request from your branch.


2. **Describe Pull Request**: Describe the changes you made, reference the issue number, and mention the maintainers for review.

3. **Wait for Review**: Maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback. Be patient and address any comments or suggestions they might have.
