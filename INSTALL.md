# Installation Guide

üìã This guide will walk you through the installation process for the program. Please follow the steps below to ensure a successful installation.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, please make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Access to a Linux terminal (Mac or Ubuntu) or a WSL on Windows
- Subscription to Rapidapi and the Linkedin Job search service: [Rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/jaypat87/api/linkedin-jobs-search)

## Step 0: Clone the repository and create a virtual environment and install the software.

Clone the repository to your local environment and create the virtual environment.

```bash
conda create --name jobhunter python=3.10
conda activate jobhunter
pip install .
```

## Step 1: Copy the .env-template

To begin, we need to copy the `.env-template` file into `.env` so that the program can work properly. Use the following command to accomplish this:

```shell
cp .env-template .env
```

## Step 2: Add required API Key
### Add Rapid API KEY
Next, open the `.env` file in a text editor and add your Rapid API Key. This key is required for the program to function correctly. If you don't have a Rapid API Key, you can sign up for one [here](https://www.rapidapi.com/).

### Add OpenAI API KEY (Optional)
You can also add OpenAI API key to the `.env` file to get GPT based resume similarity score. This is optional feature, and currently in development, and will be available in full version soon. You can sign up for OpenAI API [here](https://platform.openai.com/apps)


## Step 5: Set up Dependencies and Test the Installation

To ensure that everything is set up correctly, run the following command to run the install all dependencies and run unit tests on the jobhunter:

```shell
make check
```

If there are no errors, then everything is working properly. If you encounter errors during installation, please make sure you have followed all the steps described above. If you can't fix the issue, open up an issue in this Github repo for triaging.

# Running via Command Line

If you want to run your application locally, you can run the following command in the command line:

```bash
jobhunter
```

# Running on Docker

## Step 1: Create a Docker image, then create a container and pass the .env file

To create a Docker image, you need to run the appropriate Docker command on the Dockerfile. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from the official website [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

```shell
sh run_docker.sh
```
