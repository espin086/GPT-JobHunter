In new product design roles: develops and programs integrated software algorithms to structure analyze and leverage data in product and systems applications in both structured and unstructured environments. Develops and communicates descriptive diagnostic predictive and prescriptive insights/algorithms. In product/systems improvement projects: uses machine language and statistical modeling techniques such as decision trees logistic regression Bayesian analysis and others to develop and evaluate algorithms to improve product/system performance quality data management and accuracy. In both theoretical development environments and specific product design implementation and improvement environments uses current programming language and technologies to translate algorithms and technical specifications into code. Completes programming and implements efficiencies performs testing and debugging. Completes documentation and procedures for installation and maintenance. Applies deep learning technologies to give computers the capability to visualize learn and respond to complex situations. Adapts machine learning to areas such as virtual reality augmented reality artificial intelligence robotics and other products that allow users to have an interactive experience. Can work with large scale computing frameworks data analysis systems and modeling environments.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIALIST CAREER STREAM: An individual contributor with responsibility in our technical functions to advance existing technology or introduce new technology and therapies. Formulates delivers and/or manages projects assigned and works with other stakeholders to achieve desired results. May act as a mentor to colleagues or may direct the work of other lower level professionals. The majority of time is spent delivering RampD systems or initiatives related to new technologies or therapies ndash from design to implementation - while adhering to policies using specialized knowledge and skills.\n\nDIFFERENTIATING FACTORS\n\nAutonomy: Recognized expert managing large projects or processes. Exercises considerable latitude in determining deliverables of assignments with limited oversight from manager. Coaches reviews and delegates work to lower level specialists.\n\nOrganizational Impact: Contributes to defining the direction for new products processes standards or operational plans based on business strategy with a significant impact on work group results. May manage large projects or processes that span outside of immediate job area.\n\nInnovation and Complexity: Problems and issues faced are difficult moderately complex and undefined and require detailed information gathering analysis and investigation. Develops solutions to moderately complex problems and/or makes moderate to significant improvements of processes systems or products independently to enhance performance of job area. Implements solutions to problems.\n\nCommunication and Influence: Represents organization as a primary contact for specific projects and initiatives communicates with internal and external customers and vendors at various levels. May negotiate with others to reach understanding or agreement and influence decision-making.\n\nLeadership and Talent Management: Typically provides guidance coaching and training to other employees within job area. Typically manages major / moderately complex projects involving delegation of work and review of work products at times acting as a team leader.\n\nRequired Knowledge and Experience: Requires mastery of a specialty area and full knowledge of industry practices typically obtained through advanced education combined with experience.
