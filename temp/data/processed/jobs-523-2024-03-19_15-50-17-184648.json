Reporting to the CEO, the VP will manage a national team responsible for cultivating relationships with city and county leaders, overseeing procurement and contracting, and engaging with local and national philanthropic partners. The role also involves serving as a key member of the leadership team and closely collaborating with all other departments to ensure cross-organizational alignment, goal achievement, and mission impact.\n\nLOCATION: FUSE is a fully virtual organization and this position can be based remotely from anywhere in the United States.\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nFUSE is a national nonprofit that partners with local governments to address pressing challenges with equitable solutions. We place experienced professionals within city and county agencies to lead strategic projects that are designed to address local needs, increase government effectiveness, narrow racial disparities, and accelerate systems change. Since 2012, FUSE has led over 400 projects in 58 governments across 26 states, impacting a total population equivalent to 1 in 10 Americans.\n\nWhen designing each fellowship project, FUSE works closely with local stakeholders to define a scope of work that will achieve a substantive impact on regional priorities. We then conduct an individualized search for each project to ensure that the selected candidate has the required competencies and is deeply connected to the communities they serve. Hired as a FUSE employee and embedded in a government agency for at least one year of full-time work, the executive fellow receives training, coaching, and professional support to ensure that they achieve their greatest potential for impact.\n\nWe are focused on issues such as workforce development, affordable housing, public health, educational access, criminal justice reform, and climate resilience. FUSE breaks down barriers between governments and the people they serve, using human-centered design to engage community members in policy development. We foster culture change within governments to promote data-driven and results-based decision making. We also utilize storytelling to share the insights from our work in order to inspire all civic leaders to think and act differently in pursuing systemic change.\n\nThis work is financially supported primarily through fee-for-service contracts with our government partners. Additional support is provided by local funders and national philanthropic investments from groups such as the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, Ballmer Group, Waverley Street Foundation, and others. We are also proud to partner with recording artist and FUSE Board member John Legend on a campaign called HumanLevel, which is using public awareness and policy advocacy to uplift communities that have been disproportionately impacted by institutionalized racism.\n\nFor more information: https://www.fuse.org\n\nOPPORTUNITY\n\nFUSE seeks an entrepreneurial leader and manager to serve as its next Vice President of Strategic Partnerships. Reporting directly to the CEO, this role is responsible for overseeing all government sales and contracting, fundraising at the local and national levels, and the initial envisioning and design of our executive fellowship projects.\n\nThe Vice President will lead a team of professional staff who are responsible for ensuring that the organization is able to pursue its mission with a sustainable, predictable, and balanced revenue stream. Working in collaboration with other departments, the Strategic Partnerships team makes determinations about the regions in which we will work, the host agencies and community partners with whom we will partner, and the core deliverables of up to one hundred unique fellowship projects each year.\n\nGiven the volume and complexity of this work, it is essential for the Vice President to effectively oversee the partnership team\u2019s data management, operating plans, assessment efforts, and internal communications. It also requires identifying and building strategic and scalable partnerships with new and existing municipalities. Working closely with the rest of the leadership team and the FUSE Board, the Vice President will help determine the organization\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nOrganizational & Team Leadership\n\u2022 Serve as a key member of FUSE\u2019s five-person leadership team, which includes the CEO, the President & COO, the Vice President of Programs, and the Vice President of Recruitment. Support strategic visioning, goal setting, planning, and budgeting. Work closely with the two other Vice Presidents to ensure effective collaboration, alignment, and cohesion throughout the organization.\n\u2022 Lead a team of high-performing, experienced professionals to ensure that strategic revenue goals are reliably achieved. Engage directly in the day-to-day work of the team, serving as a hands-on manager, thought partner, and mentor. Foster the team\u2019s professional development, sustainability, and wellness. Develop systems for tracking data and revenue, managing pipelines and relationships, assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of the team, and ensuring alignment across teams.\n\u2022 Support FUSE\u2019s Marketing & Communications team to ensure that prospective government and philanthropic partners are more aware of our work. Engage with John Legend\u2019s social impact team on the HumanLevel campaign. Represent FUSE as an attendee or speaker at events and conferences, either virtually or in-person. Participate in FUSE Board meetings, delivering progress updates when required and working to implement the Board\u2019s recommendations.\n\u2022 Partner with the CEO on national fundraising and efforts to elevate FUSE\u2019s brand with prospective major investors. Collaborate with the Program Team and Marketing & Communications Team to continually collect data and stories of community impact that can be shared with funders. Support the development of pitch materials and the customization of content for funders who are interested in specific issue areas or particular regions of the country.\n\u2022 Personally model FUSE\u2019s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in every aspect of leadership and daily work. Reflecting the nature of FUSE\u2019s program model, place racial equity at the center of the team\u2019s efforts to select government partners, engage local leaders, design fellowships, hire staff, select vendors, and partner with value-aligned funders.\n\nGovernment Partnerships & Sales\n\u2022 Manage a team of Directors who each oversee a portfolio of regions, including both current and prospective partners. Directors work with city and county government leaders to identify high-priority projects in which a FUSE Executive Fellow would address local needs, accelerate systems change and narrow racial disparities. Ensure that the Directors are continually building and sustaining relationships with an array of cross-sector, community-based partners in every region.\n\u2022 Secure required funding to cover the cost of every project, primarily from fee-for-service government contracts. Ensure that every aspect of a complex approval and contracting process is completed for every project by the deadline established for each cohort. FUSE launches cohorts of 30 concurrently running fellowship projects, with two cohorts annually in the spring and fall.\n\u2022 Closely coordinate with FUSE\u2019s Recruiting team and Program team to provide forecasts about the number, location, and nature of upcoming projects in each cohort. This cross-team communication is essential to ensure that Recruiting has time to conduct a full executive search for each individual project and that Programs can plan ahead to fully onboard, train, coach, and support each cohort.\n\u2022 Work closely with the Program team to extend as many fellowships as possible beyond their initial year. FUSE offers the opportunity for a project extension in cases where the fellow and government host are both interested in continuing the work and there is funding to support an additional six or twelve months of work. Each extension requires a new scope of work and a government contract.\n\nRequirements\n\u2022 Passion for FUSE\u2019s mission, a belief in the power of local governments to positively impact society\u2019s biggest challenges, a commitment to advancing racial equity, and a vision for accelerating systemic change within communities.\n\u2022 Experience working in or with local governments would be highly valuable in this role.\n\u2022 15+ years of experience in roles with direct responsibility for managing teams of professionals, ideally those who are responsible for sales, partnerships, or related activities.\n\u2022 Demonstrated experience building and leading highly effective teams, using a collaborative and respectful management style that focuses on teamwork, inclusivity, and organizational culture. High emotional intelligence and cultural competence are a must.\n\u2022 Experience creating effective data tracking and reporting systems, particularly related to managing complex processes, systems, and data. Familiarity with the use of Salesforce is a plus.\n\u2022 Highly strategic mindset, including the demonstrated ability to take broad ideas and turn them into actionable plans.
