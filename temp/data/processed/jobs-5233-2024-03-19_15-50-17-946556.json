Our mission is to provide manufacturers with a robotic solution that can be deployed against simple tasks in hours rather than weeks and at a fraction of the cost of other automation solutions that require extensive manual programming. Our solution is driven by the belief that every innovation should be purposeful and that the simplest solution is usually the best one. Guided by these principles, we create turnkey robotic work cells to solve our customers\u2019 operational challenges.\n\nAt Rapid, everyone has a seat at our table, and we encourage collaboration and sharing ideas. We value mutual respect, innovate with purpose, and, most importantly, put our customers first. These values have helped us build toward becoming the biggest provider of robotics automation solutions.\n\nFounded in 2019, we are a Series B company that has raised $54M in funding. Our headquarters is in San Francisco, California, with an additional office in Novi, Michigan.\n\nPrincipal Machine Learning Engineer, Robotic Perception\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe are looking for a Principal Machine Learning Engineer who will spearhead the efforts of our machine learning team, focusing on developing innovative deep learning vision algorithms for robotic grasping in practical, automation applications. This role involves working closely with robotics and platform engineers to create end-to-end AI enabled robotic products. Your ultimate goal is to design and develop machine learning models that enable our robots to understand and interact efficiently with the physical world.\n\nCandidates for this role should possess a strong foundation in machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and robotics. You should have experience in Python and be familiar with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face. The ideal candidate will demonstrate an ability to work both collaboratively and independently, and shift efficiently between conceptualizing high-level architecture and detailing low-level implementation specifics.\n\nYou\u2019re a good fit if you:\n\u2022 Hold a PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, AI, or a related field, or have equivalent experience\n\u2022 Possess 10+ years of experience in machine learning, specifically with developing and implementing deep learning models\n\u2022 Have a strong understanding of both 2D and 3D perception techniques as applied to robotics\n\u2022 Are experienced with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or equivalent\n\u2022 Have a proven track record in creating and implementing complex machine learning systems\n\u2022 Have experience with unit testing, functional testing, and best practices for ML model evaluation\n\u2022 Demonstrate experience with Git, code review processes, and agile methodologies\n\u2022 Possess a robust understanding of distributed computing and managing large scale machine learning systems: instrumenting, monitoring, debugging, performance analysis, and optimization\n\u2022 Exhibit confidence being hands-on from initial brainstorming, through prototyping, into building and deploying the final product\n\u2022 Have experience with ROS2. Although not mandatory, would be a strong plus\n\nWhat you\u2019ll accomplish:\n\u2022 Model Selection & Adaptation: You will have the opportunity to scrutinize and select the best machine learning models and techniques that align with our specific requirements. This involves not only choosing the right architecture and algorithms but also making critical adjustments to optimize them for our unique needs.\n\u2022 End-to-End Perception Pipeline Development: In collaboration with our software team, you will work on developing a robust perception pipeline. This pipeline will include a blend of traditional computer vision techniques and advanced machine learning algorithms, carefully designed and orchestrated to provide our robots with the best understanding of their surroundings.\n\u2022 Innovation in Robotic Vision: You will apply your expertise in ML and computer vision to push the boundaries of what's possible in robotic perception. By developing novel vision algorithms, you will empower our robots to operate effectively in a variety of complex and dynamic environments.\n\nThe salary range for this full-time position is between $200,000 - $280,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your targeted location during the hiring process.\n\nPerks of Working At Rapid\n\nWe are proud to offer a comprehensive total rewards package, competitive base salary, ownership in the company, 401k, and health (medical, dental, and vision insurance). Our benefits also provide access to mental healthcare programs and virtual health services.\n\nWe offer a flexible work environment and value work-life balance - so our team can focus on what matters most. We have a flexible time-off policy - with one requirement - take time off to rest and recharge! Our company is closed for \"Rapid Winter Break,\" between Christmas and the new year.\n\nWe have also created programs to encourage our team to connect and build relationships - \"coffee buddies\" and employee-led groups (virtual and in-person) like our beloved #furbots Slack channel and Women at Rapid.\n\nOur Team is What Makes Us Special\n\nWe are proudly committed to cultivating a culture of diversity, inclusion, and connectedness that celebrates our differences in identity, experience, and point of view. We strive to create a workplace that reflects the communities we serve and empowers everyone to bring their whole, authentic selves to work.\n\nRapid Robotics is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment based on race, color, sex, age, educational background, national origin, citizenship, marital status, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or expression, lifestyle, veteran status, disability or any other federal, state or local protected class.\n\nRapid Robotics requires full COVID vaccination for employment in accordance with our Company's Vaccination Policy.", "highlights": "\nQualifications:\n Candidates for this role should possess a strong foundation in machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and robotics, You should have experience in Python and be familiar with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, The ideal candidate will demonstrate an ability to work both collaboratively and independently, and shift efficiently between conceptualizing high-level architecture and detailing low-level implementation specifics, Hold a PhD in Computer Science, Machine Learning, AI, or a related field, or have equivalent experience, Possess 10+ years of experience in machine learning, specifically with developing and implementing deep learning models, Have a strong understanding of both 2D and 3D perception techniques as applied to robotics, Are experienced with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or equivalent, Have a proven track record in creating and implementing complex machine learning systems, Have experience with unit testing, functional testing, and best practices for ML model evaluation, Demonstrate experience with Git, code review processes, and agile methodologies, Possess a robust understanding of distributed computing and managing large scale machine learning systems: instrumenting, monitoring, debugging, performance analysis, and optimization, Exhibit confidence being hands-on from initial brainstorming, through prototyping, into building and deploying the final product, Have experience with ROS2, \nResponsibilities:\n This role involves working closely with robotics and platform engineers to create end-to-end AI enabled robotic products, Your ultimate goal is to design and develop machine learning models that enable our robots to understand and interact efficiently with the physical world, Model Selection & Adaptation: You will have the opportunity to scrutinize and select the best machine learning models and techniques that align with our specific requirements, End-to-End Perception Pipeline Development: In collaboration with our software team, you will work on developing a robust perception pipeline, \nBenefits:\n The salary range for this full-time position is between $200,000 - $280,000 + bonus + equity + benefits, Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your targeted location during the hiring process, Perks of Working At Rapid, We are proud to offer a comprehensive total rewards package, competitive base salary, ownership in the company, 401k, and health (medical, dental, and vision insurance), Our benefits also provide access to mental healthcare programs and virtual health services, We offer a flexible work environment and value work-life balance - so our team can focus on what matters most", "resume_similarity": null}
