Commerce and financial transactions are increasingly moving online. While the internet has enabled easier and instantaneous payments, it has also introduced a layer of anonymity between the transacting parties. To fully leverage the power of online commerce: there must be mutual trust between parties. Without trust, commerce cannot happen.\n\nBy providing a clear, accurate assessment of risk at multiple points of the end-user journey, we enable merchants to eliminate fraud losses, and create adaptive, frictionless experiences for low risk payments. We believe that machine learning is THE way to empower internet-scale businesses to prevent payment fraud.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Do\n\u2022 Research and analyze the gaps in our ML models (false positives and false negatives), observe and summarize fraudulent behavior patterns.\n\u2022 Define success metrics, and propose targeted model improvements so we can serve our customers better.\n\u2022 Collaborate with engineers on the team to build scalable and generalized ML models, ML features, or training regimes so we can prevent fraud at large scale with low latency.\n\u2022 Build systems that explain how a model arrived at a prediction.\n\u2022 Communicate effectively to influence stakeholders for buy-in.\n\u2022 Leverage anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual behaviors for customer traffic patterns\n\nWhat Would Make You a Strong Fit\n\u2022 Practical understanding of machine learning and data science concepts, and a track record of solving problems through rigorous ML paradigms.\n\u2022 Experience working with large datasets using Jupyter, Pandas, PySpark, PyTorch, Tensorflow or similar technologies.\n\u2022 Strong knowledge of statistics, experiment design, data science hypothesis and ML problem framing\n\u2022 Laser-focused on delivering customer value and prefer practicality over theoretical impact\n\u2022 Python coding and analytical tool building.\n\u2022 Strong communication & collaboration skills, and a belief that team output is more important than individual output\n\u2022 Degree in Statistics, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Operations Research, or a related field\n\nBonus points\n\u2022 Experience working with scalable, real-time prediction systems in production\n\u2022 Familiarity with multiple machine learning or statistical packages in Python, R, MATLAB, or another programming language\n\u2022 Experience evaluating model performance\n\u2022 Advanced degree in Statistics, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Operations Research, or a related field\n\nA little about us:\n\nSift is the leading innovator in Digital Trust & Safety. Hundreds of disruptive, forward-thinking companies like Zillow, and Twitter trust Sift to deliver outstanding customer experience while preventing fraud and abuse.\n\nThe Sift engine powers Digital Trust & Safety by helping companies stop fraud before it happens. But it\u2019s not just another anti-fraud platform: Sift enables businesses to tailor experiences to each customer according to the risk they pose. That means fraudsters experience friction, but honest users do not. By drawing on insights from our global network of customers, Sift allows businesses to scale, win, and thrive in the digital era.\n\nBenefits and Perks:\n\u2022 Competitive total compensation package\n\u2022 401k plan\n\u2022 Medical, dental and vision coverage\n\u2022 Wellness reimbursement\n\u2022 Education reimbursement\n\u2022 Flexible time off\n\nLet\u2019s Build It Together\n\nAt Sift, we are intentionally building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. We believe that diversity drives innovation, equity is a fundamental right, and inclusion is a basic human need. We envision a place where all Sifties feel secure sharing their authentic selves and diverse experiences with their teams, their customers, and their community \u2013 ultimately using this empowerment and authenticity to build trust and create a safer Internet.\n\nThis document provides transparency around the way in which Sift handles personal data of job applicants: https://sift.com/recruitment-privacy", "highlights": "\nQualifications:\n Practical understanding of machine learning and data science concepts, and a track record of solving problems through rigorous ML paradigms, Experience working with large datasets using Jupyter, Pandas, PySpark, PyTorch, Tensorflow or similar technologies, Strong knowledge of statistics, experiment design, data science hypothesis and ML problem framing, Laser-focused on delivering customer value and prefer practicality over theoretical impact, Python coding and analytical tool building, Strong communication & collaboration skills, and a belief that team output is more important than individual output, Experience working with scalable, real-time prediction systems in production, Familiarity with multiple machine learning or statistical packages in Python, R, MATLAB, or another programming language, Experience evaluating model performance, Advanced degree in Statistics, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Operations Research, or a related field, \nResponsibilities:\n Research and analyze the gaps in our ML models (false positives and false negatives), observe and summarize fraudulent behavior patterns, Define success metrics, and propose targeted model improvements so we can serve our customers better, Collaborate with engineers on the team to build scalable and generalized ML models, ML features, or training regimes so we can prevent fraud at large scale with low latency, Build systems that explain how a model arrived at a prediction, Communicate effectively to influence stakeholders for buy-in, Leverage anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual behaviors for customer traffic patterns, \nBenefits:\n Competitive total compensation package, 401k plan, Medical, dental and vision coverage, Wellness reimbursement, Education reimbursement, Flexible time off", "resume_similarity": null}
