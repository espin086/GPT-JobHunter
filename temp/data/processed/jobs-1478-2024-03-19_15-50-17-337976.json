T-Division provides a unique and engaging environment that fosters multi-disciplinary collaborations to support the laboratory's strategic basic research and national security missions. The Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics (T-5) group within T-Division conducts diverse research across a variety of topics including fusion science, space plasma science, astrophysics, numerical analysis, machine learning, computational imaging, optimization, artificial intelligence, environmental sciences, and the modeling of critical infrastructure (gas pipelines and electrical grids). These application areas are tied together by research in novel algorithms and numerical methods.\n\nThis position is part of LANL's Advanced Network Science Initiative (ANSI) team. ANSI performs basic and applied research focused on modeling and understanding the nation's critical infrastructures, such as electric power and natural gas. Our expertise covers statistics, stochastic methods, machine learning, control theory, dynamical systems, discrete and continuous optimization, statistical physics, and graphical modeling. We ensure the scientific and technological validity of our approaches by working closely with physicists, engineers, mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and economists through interdisciplinary collaborations. Our typical customers include DHS, DOE, DOD, and other national laboratories. Our research requires close collaborations within and outside the Laboratory. More details on ANSI can be found at https://lanl-ansi.github.io/\n\nCandidates are expected to support programs within the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity, Office of Science, ARPA-E, and similar sponsors. Programs and projects include control and optimization of networks under uncertainty, analysis of extreme events, design of resilient networks, modeling of interdependent networks, machine learning for infrastructure systems, and fundamentals of optimization, machine learning, and quantum computing methods. Selected candidates will work with the team to conduct novel research in the areas listed above, will publish the results in peer-reviewed journals, and will present at conferences and workshops. They will also be developing their own R&D portfolio within the larger team. The candidates will participate in the development of proposals to internal and external organizations to fund the teams research activities. The candidate is expected to work in an interdisciplinary environment with substantial collaborative research. This includes collaborating with scientists and managers to develop and sustain programs as well as recruiting, mentoring, and supporting students and postdocs. They will be expected to foster an inclusive environment at the workplace.\n\nWhat You Need\n\nMinimum Job Requirements:\n\n\u2022 Expertise in one or more of the following areas: artificial intelligence, machine learning, optimization, control theory, data science, computational science, applied mathematics, or quantum information science.\n\n\u2022 Ability to work effectively in a collaborative environment.\n\n\u2022 Technical oral and written skills as demonstrated through publications and conference presentations.\n\nEducation/Experience: Position requires a Bachelor' degree in a STEM field from an accredited college and university and 4 years of related experience, typically with post-doctoral research experience at a university or national lab or equivalent experience directly related to the occupation.\n\nDesired Qualifications:\n\u2022 Experience in proposal development.\n\u2022 Programming experience with C++, Java, Julia, MATLAB, or Python.\n\u2022 Experience with artificial intelligence or machine learning.\n\u2022 Optimization modeling experience with AMPL, GAMS, JuMP, or Pyomo.\n\u2022 Experience with open-source software and commercial solvers (CPLEX, Gurobi, IPO, pT, PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.).\n\u2022 Experience with mentoring students or postdocs.\n\u2022 Ability to obtain a DOE Q Clearance.\n\n\u2022\n\nWork Location: The work location for this position is onsite and located in Los Alamos, NM.
