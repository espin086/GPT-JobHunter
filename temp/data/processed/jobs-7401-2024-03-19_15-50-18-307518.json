These Data Centers are the foundation upon which our rapidly scaling business operates, and upon which all of our services such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp etc. are delivered to our worldwide user base consisting of approximately half of the world's population.This silicon team is responsible for building hardware accelerators for Data Center servers, to offload the most computationally demanding workloads and execute them with higher performance and lower energy consumption as compared to running them on the CPU/GPU of the server. This is a architect role in which you will be defining the architecture of the next generation of Machine Learning ASICs being built on the most modern process technologies and featuring industry leading performance and feature sets.\n\nRequired Skills:\n\nMachine Learning SoC Architect Responsibilities:\n\n1. Work on algorithm analysis, performance analysis and architecture definition of Machine Learning ASICs.\n\n2. Map Data Center workloads to heterogeneous ASICs that contain multiple different programmable processors and hardware accelerators. Perform detailed calculations to specify computation throughput, memory bandwidth and latency\n\n3. evaluate performance v/s area v/s power tradeoffs.\n\n4. Drive the architecture definition of one or more of the following ASIC sub-systems: compute, memory, Network-On-Chip (NoC), collectives, debug etc. and chiplet based multi-die SoCs.\n\n5. Identify appropriate workloads and micro-benchmarks to be used for performance analysis and drive this analysis on simulation and emulation platforms to define and validate the architecture.\n\n6. Evangelize your innovative architectural solutions with your peers and leadership, while mentoring members of the architecture team.\n\n7. Collaborate with cross functional teams working on RTL design, Design Verification, Firmware/Software development, Pre-Post silicon validation and Program Management to deliver first pass functional silicon on an aggressive schedule.\n\n8. Collaborate with software and firmware teams to ensure that the ASIC meets end to end application performance goals while maintaining ease and efficiency of software development.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\n9. Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, relevant technical field, or equivalent practical experience.\n\n10. Experience and knowledge of Computer Architecture concepts such as microprocessor architecture, memory systems, on-chip interconnection networks, hardware/software partitioning etc.\n\n11. 20+ years of prior experience in defining and delivering multiple high performance ASICs into production, with focus on architecture definition and performance analysis.\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n\n12. Master's or PhD degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering or related field.\n\n13. Domain knowledge in one or more of power/performance tradeoffs, digital signal processing, ML networks, ML frameworks such as Pytorch.\n\n14. Programming in C or C++ with knowledge of mapping hardware algorithms to efficient C/C++ code.\n\nPublic Compensation:\n\n$212,000/year to $291,000/year + bonus + equity + benefits\n\nIndustry: Internet\n\nEqual Opportunity:\n\nMeta is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.
