This commitment is brought to life in the Institute for Data Science in Oncology (IDSO), a flagship program designed to reshape patient experiences and fast-track scientific breakthroughs via data-driven cancer care methodologies. The IDSO embodies a data-centric culture, pushing the envelope of modern care and venturing into uncharted territories of cancer research and treatment. It is home to a vibrant team of data scientists committed to unraveling complex cancer challenges, reducing time between diagnosis and treatment decisions, and accelerating drug discovery.\n\nMDACC is recruiting Data Scientists for its newly established Computational Pathology program. This program aims to distil meaningful insights from the extensive resources and data available at MD Anderson, particularly from cancer pathology that is currently benefiting from a digital revolution. Automated, unbiased sample selection and scalable study design will immediately facilitate deep spatial investigations in landmark MD Anderson programs, including APOLLO and Patient MOSAIC, to direct novel data analysis, enable translational studies, and generate clinical impact.\n\nMDACC provides the ideal environment for developing, testing, and deploying AI technologies for improved early cancer diagnosis and accurate treatment selection. The Computational Pathology program is a key focus area of the IDSO and supports the IDSO's mission to drive high-impact discovery research by optimizing multidimensional data integration, analysis, and application.\n\nWe seek data scientists to develop, implement, and deploy innovative computational pipelines for medical images. Successful candidates will develop cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing methods for digital pathology, conduct data analysis, collaborate and consult with pathologists and clinicians to address key clinical challenges that will have an impact on our patients.\n\nIdeal candidates will have a minimum of a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Physics, Applied Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Computer Science, Statistics, Computational Biology, or related field. With Three years of experience in scientific software development/analysis (specifically in Python, image processing and Deep Learning)\n\nJOB SPECIFIC COMPETENCIES\n\nDevelop impact-driven AI technologies for pathology Develop and maintain computational methods using deep learning for pathological image processing.\n\nWork with a high interdisciplinary team to generate biologically meaningful results and work towards clinical implementation of AI technology for oncology.\n\nDevelop key performance metrics to demonstrate image processing accuracy.\n\nKeep current and evaluate state-of-the-art methods and tools, establish and help maintain computational infrastructure and analytic pipelines.\n\nParticipate in the design of pathology/biological/sequencing experiment to generate high quality data for machine learning.\n\nPresent results in collaboration meetings, internal and external conferences.\n\nPrioritize and manage multiple projects in a timely and resource efficient manner.\n\nOrganize and provide up-to-date documentation for data and code, and help write scientific publications and reports.\n\nOther Other duties as assigned\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nEducation Required: Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Physics, Applied Mathematics, Science, Engineering, Computer Science, Statistics, Computational Biology, or related field.\n\nEducation Preferred: Master's or Ph.D.\n\nExperience Required: Three years experience in scientific software development/analysis\n\nExperience Preferred: With Master's degree, one years experience required.
