By supporting long-term partnerships between classroom teachers and professional artists, we boost students' critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, and academic achievement while also building teacher capacity and bringing valuable resources to schools in low income neighborhoods across Chicago.\n\nMarketing Strategy - Google Ads Optimization\n\nRole\n\nWe're seeking a volunteer to help us maximize our Google Ad Grant. This project will play a key role in our organization's ability to grow brand awareness and impact community members. This project may include the following activities:\n\u2022 Development of our nonprofit's Google Ads strategy, targeting gaining more attendance for our organization's gallery events\n\u2022 Training one or two staff members on how to update Google Ads and monitor their performance\n\u2022 Setting up integration between Google Ads and Google Analytics\n\u2022 Making recommendations for future search engine optimization or content management projects that will improve our Google Ads health\n\nOur ideal volunteer has experience with Google Ads and/or search engine marketing and copywriting skills. CAPE's website is built on WordPress and maintained by staff.\n\nChicago Arts Partnerships in Education places teaching artists in schools in order to expand creative learning opportunities for struggling students who do not have regular access to the arts. In addition, CAPE produces regular exhibitions of student, teacher, and artist work in its art gallery and professional development space on Chicago's near Southside. CAPE would like to build awareness of its gallery, exhibitions, and events by using a robust online advertising strategy to target audiences near Bridgeport, as well as near participating schools. CAPE maintains social media accounts, which also could be more robustly used for promotion. CAPE has two exhibitions coming up this spring: Perspectives (Opening April 1) and Convergence (Opening about May 1). CAPE needs an experienced Google Ads manager to use established copy and photos to promote the exhibitions and events.\n\nTo prepare, we have activated Google Ads for our website and secured a Google Ad Grant award. We are prepared to share the login credentials to our Google Workspace. In our first session together, we'll brief you on our marketing goals, as well as our mission, vision, and purpose. Your training of our team members on Google Ads best practices will help ensure the long-term successful implementation of the great work you share with us.\n\nThis project can be done remotely.", "highlights": "\nResponsibilities:\n Training one or two staff members on how to update Google Ads and monitor their performance, Setting up integration between Google Ads and Google Analytics, CAPE would like to build awareness of its gallery, exhibitions, and events by using a robust online advertising strategy to target audiences near Bridgeport, as well as near participating schools", "resume_similarity": null}
