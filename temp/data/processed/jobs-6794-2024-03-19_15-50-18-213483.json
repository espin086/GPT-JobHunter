Connect. Grow. Around here, we define the future. But we at KBR we share one goal: to improve the world responsibly as a company of innovators, thinkers, creators, explorers, volunteers, and dreamers.\n\nDelivering Solutions, Changing the World. We deliver science, technology, and engineering solutions to governments and companies around the world. - https://www.kbr.com/en\n\nKBR\u2019s Science and Space division is seeking a Remote Sensing Data Scientist to support our Technical Support Services Contract (TSSC) with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center (http://eros.usgs.gov/), located near Sioux Falls, SD (http://www.siouxfalls.org).\n\nAre you a data scientist professional who is looking to flex your AI/ML skills to develop cutting edge geospatial products that can make a difference in the world? How would you like to leverage over 50 years of continuous Earth monitoring products, afforded by Landsat and other satellite missions, to study trends in change and create high-level geospatial science products to monitor, assess, and project land cover change? If your interests are piqued, keep reading!\n\nThis position is aligned with the Science Division of the TSSC and will support projects of the USGS\u2019s Integrated Science and Applications Branch (ISAB) at the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. The projects include the USGS EROS Land Cover Program on the Land Cover Next Project and EcoAI. EcoAI uses advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to monitor the health of and changes to Earth\u2019s most sensitive ecosystems (the North Slope of Alaska) that are essential for assessing the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities. EcoAI uses remote observations from optical, radar and lidar sensors in combination with field collected data to identify and model the impacts of land change. The LCNext project develops foundational capabilities and geospatial products for integrating land cover and land cover change science .\n\nThe main objective is to design, develop, and implement an operational capability for monitoring, assessing, and projecting land cover, land cover change, and impervious surface and to use this framework to support scientific research for understanding a changing Earth. Land cover and land use data are high priority data themes within the USGS. These data are often combined with other sources of relevant scientific data to provide a robust suite of geospatial data that allow informed decisions by managers and the public. Land cover map data (and derived products) require repeated production, updating and improvement, to provide the most relevant land cover and land cover change information for the Nation. The work of these projects includes coordination with teams of exceptionally skilled remote sensing scientists, data scientists, systems/software engineers, and communications specialists, as well as collaboration with our USGS customers at the EROS Center.\n\nRead on to see if you\u2019re a match.
