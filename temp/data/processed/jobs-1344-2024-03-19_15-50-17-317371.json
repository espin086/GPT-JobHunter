Oligo data scientists will serve a dual purpose of co-developing a data capture & analysis platform with oligo sciences experts and translating their needs broadly across GSK to build methods/models/capabilities that fulfil them. Key Responsibilities: Co-design and implement a target tractability system for oligo-guided therapeutic mechanisms such as RNA degradation/interference, and up/down modulation of alternative splicing, poly-adenylation, A>I editing, etc. Co-develop a target/complex engagement model that combines target sequence, secondary+ tertiary structure, and oligo chemistry to drive binding assay designs for both high-throughput screening and low-latency optimization. Collaborate effectively with renowned GSK experts in genetics, genomics, computational bio & chem, structural biology and medicinal chemistry, artificial intelligence / machine learning, and digital technologies to build the datasets, tools, models, and infrastructure necessary for oligo design & development. Why You? Basic Qualifications: PhD degree in computational life sciences (e.g. bio/med/chem/stats/informatics) with at least 1 (co-)first and 1 supporting authorship Over 4 years industry experience (or postdoc + 2 years industry) demonstrated by published articles/patents/talks/awards Over 2 years experience with genomic data infrastructure for either public or private collections (e.g. ENCODE, TCGA, DepMap, GTEx, cellXgene, UK biobank) Over 2 years experience with cheminformatic and structural modelling of drug-target binding for small or large molecules validated by real qSAR assays Preferred Qualifications: Demonstrated cross-functional communication, matrixed collaboration, both team and thought leadership Performed target identification or tractability/prioritization for RNA-modulating approaches or RNA-targeted modalities Participated in high-throughput or high-content screening for hits followed by low-latency iterations for lead optimization Developed analytic tools & data pipelines for processing & querying large batches of disease/perturbation/control samples Biology research focus on either coding or non-coding RNA and its post-transcriptional regulation in various eukaryotic cells/tissues Chemistry research focus on oligonucleotide modifications: either synthetic sugars/backbones, or natural nucleobase variants Mastery of statistical learning or predictive modelling with signals and noise in empirical datasets: either observational or perturbational Mastery of predictive analytics and modern data stack: principal developer on a codebase in Python/R/Julia/C++/Java/Rust, or considerable and consistent contributions to an open-source project, or Top10 placement in life-science-themed competitions on Kaggle/TopCoder/DREAM challenge. Familiarity with Bayesian statistics and machine learning (ML & DL) with prudent use of suitable methods as projects progress Familiarity with genetic mutations\u2019 impacts on both coding and non-coding RNA sequences and their associated binding proteins, especially in regulating alternative splicing, poly-adenylation, and RNA chemical modifications like methylation or editing. Knowledge of 2o and 3o structure and computational/experimental techniques (e.g. Chemical probing, NMR, CryoEM) to determine folding dynamics of eukaryotic RNAs in complex with chaperone RNP and RBPs.
