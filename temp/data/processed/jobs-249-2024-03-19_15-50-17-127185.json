You love giving and receiving feedback, and learning and growing as a team.\n\u2022    Unafraid of failure. You take risks.

As we scale, we need an ML engineer who can build high-quality products quickly.

We will look to your experience to impact our codebase and help our ML team expand its skillset.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do\n\u2022 Build high-quality products very fast.\n\u2022 Contribute to building new features from scratch as we push forward our technical roadmap.\n\u2022 Have empathy for our users and build solutions for them. And you\u2019ll be able to do this without any explicit planning or expectations.\n\u2022 Push for a high bar for the quality of our codebase and our technical decisions. You\u2019ll help in setting the standard for the future as we scale the ML organization here at Rillavoice.\n\u2022 Scale yourself. Being an early-stage company, you will need to grow in both leadership and execution as the company scales.\n\u2022 Help recruit additional scientists/engineers to expand the team.\n\nWhat you bring\n\u2022 2+ years experience in designing/implementing solutions, ideally some of it in startups.\n\u2022 Ability to move fast and iterate quickly without sacrificing quality.\n\u2022 A customer-first mindset and an interest in talking with customers to make sure what we\u2019re building meets their needs.\n\u2022 Experience across some/most of the entire stack. Ability to quickly learn and fill in the gaps.\n\u2022 Experience owning technically challenging projects.\n\nCompensation\n\nOur compensation philosophy is that we always pay top of market - above the 90th percentile.
