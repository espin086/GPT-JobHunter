As a participant in the creation of the DICOM standard, DataFirst applies its extensive DICOM knowledge and expertise to help Healthcare OEMs, enterprise Hospital systems and industry vendors meet short-term, advanced technology needs while supporting future growth. DataFirst understands that each customer presents unique needs. Accordingly, solutions and consultative services are scalable, allowing a tailored fit to the environment or application. Designing highly customizable products and services allows delivery to a small community hospital yet rapid scalability to service a large integrated delivery network (IDN).\n\nDataFirst is the leading provider of \u2018turnkey\u2019 Healthcare migration and integration services, having performed thousands of migration projects over the last 23 years. In support of industry-leading OEMs (GE, Fuji, Cerner, Siemens, Fuji Philips, Konica, etc.), DataFirst averages 200 migration projects annually representing over 60 million studies processed and migrated each year.\n\nThe DataFirst team is fully integrated and includes 40 full-time, in-house DICOM experts. Each project is managed by an integrated team of experts and includes highly trained DICOM experts, Project Managers, and Migration Engineers, as well as advanced software development resources. In addition, innovative Migration software enhancements are developed each day, with a clear focus on increasing speed and throughput for every project while preserving data integrity. DataFirst has a wide range of services to assist with any recurring challenge found in the field.\n\nDataFirst employs all these resources in-house as part of its comprehensive migration management program. DataFirst is prepared to initiate a fully documented, high-speed implementation that addresses each of the items required for success. As an early participant in the creation of the DICOM standard and a solutions-based healthcare engineering firm, DataFirst applies its industry-leading expertise to ensure true DICOM compliance and instance-level accuracy for each image migrated.\n\nAt DataFirst, we have a saying that \u201cIf you have done one project\u2026\u2026. you have done ONE project!\u201d Every project is unique with potentially a host of complications that present significant risk for completion. Every Migration project is managed from pre-sales to \u2018close out\u2019 (customer acceptance) via a dedicated team of engineers, project managers, etc. Due to database issues, media failure issues, data loss due to Source system failures, etc. it is normal to have a small amount of data that is not available. The industry average for failure is approximately 1-3% depending on the Source system and the integrity of its associated archive. DataFirst processes do not allow for ANY files to be left behind as each study is tracked and logged. Inevitably decisions are made to deal with any studies that present a challenge for the facility. In all cases, EVERY study is reviewed and accommodated. For this reason, a \u201ctool kit\u201d methodology (a widely accepted approach implemented by most of our competitors) will NEVER achieve the equivalent level of project success that DataFirst requires on every project. The DataFirst philosophy is much different than that of a DICOM toolkit provider. Instead, we employ highly trained professionals who monitor and accommodate any migration issue. In effectively all cases, the experience and troubleshooting skills of our Migration and Engineering teams provide resolve for concerns.\n\nGiven our intimate understanding of ALL imaging systems via our migration services\u2026DataFirst is in a unique position to leverage our industry experience for the benefit of our consulting services. Leveraging the powerful tools created to support the industry\u2019s leading migration company, DataFirst has recently packaged, commercialized, and launched these tools into the most comprehensive integration engine ever deployed to the Healthcare environment. The Silverback\u00ae Integration Workflow Engine represents a truly revolutionary solution in the management, migration, and intelligent routing of images within an enterprise network. This is the very same platform used throughout our consulting exercises to comprehensively interrogate an Enterprise imaging network to empirically understand where the bottlenecks are and recommendations for improvement and allow clients to maximize their assets to the fullest capabilities.\n\nAt its core, The Silverback\u00ae Integration Workflow Engine is a powerful, intelligent routing, interoperable enterprise imaging platform that ensures healthcare data (images, clinical reports, and discrete clinical information) is fully integrated and always accessible \u2013 resulting in better patient care and improved IT performance. Additionally, Silverback\u00ae empowers clinicians with an industry-leading platform for accessing, cataloging, and anonymizing clinical data for AI enablement and predictive algorithmic development. Data needs are diverse across any Healthcare enterprise and empowering clinicians with powerful interoperability tools AND the confidence to know the data is secure is critical. Whether you are working with radiology, cardiology, or any ology-related image, Silverback\u00ae has the power to anonymize and automatically de-identify patient-specific information for training, research, or the development of new machine learning algorithms!\n\nAddressing the most complex of issues impacting operational efficiency and clinical workflow, DataFirst removes the interoperability barriers within imaging enterprises to empower physicians and clinicians to experience a \u2018connected Healthcare\u2019 like never before.", "highlights": "\nQualifications:\n Experience working with healthcare executives in sales and business development, Demonstrated skills and history with DICOM workflows and technology, Revenue and account management experience, Health IT and DICOM architecture planning knowledge and experience, Excellent presentation and communication skills, Knowledge and experience with EMRs, VNAs, PACS, and/or other hospital enterprise platforms and experience with cloud providers in healthcare network environments, \nResponsibilities:\n This strategic position works closely with new and existing clients to design, develop, and deliver solutions that meet the needs and requirements of large healthcare organizations, In this role, the person will create and maintain relationships with executive-level clients and the DataFirst internal teams to ensure engagements are creative, efficient and serve as the foundation for a long-term partnership, Identify, engage, and establish relationships with large IDNs and provider organizations, Articulate the value and impact of DataFirst enterprise solutions, Design and present workflow solutions for unique customer environments, Coordinate with internal teams to overview opportunities and issues, Generate and close SW and services agreements, Quota and revenue generation responsibilities, Work closely with marketing on messaging, marcom, and lead generation activities, Participate in product roadmap and product development activities, Accordingly, solutions and consultative services are scalable, allowing a tailored fit to the environment or application, DataFirst is prepared to initiate a fully documented, high-speed implementation that addresses each of the items required for success", "resume_similarity": null}
