You will develop and prototype new models to perform automated annotation, data integration, or clinical prediction from high-parameter biological data. In this role, you will analyze complex datasets, rigorously benchmark your methods, and explore and interpret model results.\n\nThis position provides opportunities to work with leading academic research labs, co-author manuscripts, and present data. You will be exposed to diverse biological questions, gain access to one of the largest molecular datasets in the world, and participate in a collaborative, communicative culture that encourages ideas, questions, and growth. Join us and help transform how life science research is done!\n\nDuring your internship at Enable, you will:\n\u2022 Collaborate with Enable's data scientists, biologists, and engineers to develop and prototype machine learning models on highly multiplexed spatial proteomic and transcriptomic datasets\n\u2022 Deploy, benchmark, and interpret models to extract insight from high-parameter biological data\n\u2022 Present and discuss results and data with members on the Apps & Algorithms team, and across the organization\n\nWho you are:\n\u2022 Pursuing a degree in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Systems Biology, Biostatistics, Bioengineering, or similar; or equivalent professional experience\n\u2022 Significant experience in writing code in Python or R\n\u2022 Academic and/or professional experience with machine learning research on real-world problems and data\n\u2022 Continuous learner, always looking for ways to better understand a problem and experiment with solutions\n\u2022 Team-oriented and low ego\n\u2022 Ability to communicate and collaborate with people of diverse backgrounds\n\u2022 Experience with biological datasets, including proteomics, transcriptomics, functional genomics, and/or imaging datasets, is preferred\n\nLogistics:\n\u2022 The internship will run for 10-12 weeks starting end of May 2024\n\u2022 Our headquarters are based in SF, we are open to local and remote candidates!\n\nAbout Enable Medicine\n\nAt Enable Medicine, we index biological data into highly detailed maps of human disease. This atlas is utilized to guide novel drug target discovery, identify biomarkers of therapeutic response, and develop optimal treatment strategies. Our lab in Menlo Park, California, generates high-parameter biological datasets, and our cloud-based operating system allows researchers to organize, process, query, and analyze this data at scale. Taken together, our platform unlocks the ability to search biology, where complex questions about human disease can be asked and answered for the first time.\n\nWe build and provide these capabilities to our network of leading academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world. Our collaborative research spans numerous indications, with a core focus on unmet needs in oncology and autoimmune diseases. We advance science by accelerating data generation, methods development, research insights, and high-impact publications. Our interdisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, researchers, and investors focuses on decoding biological systems to make drug discovery, development, and patient care more deterministic. Come join us on our mission to decipher biology and meaningfully improve the way patients are treated.", "highlights": "\nQualifications:\n Pursuing a degree in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Systems Biology, Biostatistics, Bioengineering, or similar; or equivalent professional experience, Significant experience in writing code in Python or R, Academic and/or professional experience with machine learning research on real-world problems and data, Continuous learner, always looking for ways to better understand a problem and experiment with solutions, Team-oriented and low ego, Ability to communicate and collaborate with people of diverse backgrounds, \nResponsibilities:\n You will develop and prototype new models to perform automated annotation, data integration, or clinical prediction from high-parameter biological data, In this role, you will analyze complex datasets, rigorously benchmark your methods, and explore and interpret model results, This position provides opportunities to work with leading academic research labs, co-author manuscripts, and present data, You will be exposed to diverse biological questions, gain access to one of the largest molecular datasets in the world, and participate in a collaborative, communicative culture that encourages ideas, questions, and growth, Collaborate with Enable's data scientists, biologists, and engineers to develop and prototype machine learning models on highly multiplexed spatial proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, Deploy, benchmark, and interpret models to extract insight from high-parameter biological data, Present and discuss results and data with members on the Apps & Algorithms team, and across the organization", "resume_similarity": null}
