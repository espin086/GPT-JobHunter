This position offers the chance to create a meaningful impact in a dynamic, technology-focused company.\n\nWhat you will be doing:\n\u2022 As a member of our deep learning architecture team, you will craft system and processor architectures to extend the state of the art in deep learning efficiency and performance that are energy efficient.\n\u2022 Prototype key deep learning and data analytics algorithms and applications.\n\u2022 Analyze trade-offs in performance, cost and power developing analytical models, simulators and test suites.\n\u2022 Analyze architecture performance and energy efficiency considering deep learning workloads, modeling and explore efficient architectures.\n\u2022 Collaborate across the company to guide the direction of machine learning, working with software, research and product teams.\n\nWhat we need to see:\n\u2022 Master's Degree, PhD (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering.\n\u2022 6+ years of relevant work or research experience.\n\u2022 A strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning fundamentals to complement your expertise in computer architecture.\n\u2022 A strong background in high performance power efficient designs, energy efficient high performance computing, performance analysis and profiling to identify performance bottlenecks.\n\u2022 Fluency in programming languages such as Python, C, C++.\n\u2022 Experience and familiarity with GPU computing and parallel programming models.\n\u2022 You have firsthand work experience with analytical performance modeling, profiling, and analysis.\n\nThe GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, NVIDIA's GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why NVIDIA GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and NVIDIA is increasingly known as \"the AI computing company.\"\n\nNVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world's most desirable employers. We have some of the most forward-thinking and hardworking people in the world working for us. Are you creative and seeking new challenges? If so, we want to hear from you! Come, join our DL Architecture team and help build the real-time, cost-effective AI computing platform driving our success in this exciting and quickly growing field.\n\nThe base salary range is 180,000 USD - 339,250 USD. Your base salary will be determined based on your location, experience, and the pay of employees in similar positions.\n\nYou will also be eligible for equity and benefits. NVIDIA accepts applications on an ongoing basis.\n\nNVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
