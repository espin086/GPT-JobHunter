This individual contributor will help us build a \u201cCulture of Experimentation\u201d, accelerate product development and learning through rapid experimentation and help Chewy build differentiated experiences for pet parents and partners everywhere. In this high-visibility, high-impact role, you\u2019ll provide structure to this complex space, and identify iterative steps that add new value early and often for experimenters while still heading towards a long-term vision.\n\nThis role is inherently cross-functional; you will work closely with product managers, engineering, analytics, project management, design, marketing, finance, and executive teams to identify product insights, develop and grow business opportunities, and enhance our customer experience. As a successful leader, you\u2019ll:\n\u2022 Define and operationalize experimentation best practices, statistical and scientific methodologies and scalable frameworks for creating, monitoring, and learning from experiments.\n\u2022 Build close relationships with internal experimentation platform users, understand their preferences and gaps in their experiences and empower them to run rapid, trustworthy online experiments through training, office hours, documentation, and ad-hoc support\n\u2022 Provide consulting on test design (power analysis), choosing the right metric, defining clear hypothesis and rollout criteria, anomaly detection, and manual test readouts\n\u2022 Partner with experimentation engineering team for consistent adoption and implementation of experimentation platform SDK, and building out toolkit for developers for consistent activation of experiment across different page and platform owners.\n\u2022 Ensure quality of data and computation by developing monitoring and alerting mechanisms to catch spillovers and bias, and provide guidance on step-wise identification of root-case\n\u2022 Onboard metrics directly on the platform in order to scale the computation and enable automated readouts. Employ statistical methods and dashboards to reduce false discovery through multiple-comparisons.\n\u2022 Build out templates and processes for consistent communication & socialization of test results, and scale learnings through a centralized knowledge repo.\n\u2022 Build out and operationalize data science models to calculate annualized incremental lift on output metrics such as revenue. Create models to measure long-term impact\n\u2022 Research and recommend different testing capabilities and causal inference techniques (A/B/n testing, holdback, pre-post, MAB, targeted delivery etc) based on relevant use cases\n\u2022 Partner with existing experimentation platform provider to prioritize Chewy\u2019s experimentation use cases, and periodically evaluate latest experimentation platforms in the market\n\u2022 Define methods and metrics for measuring the platform & program's success, and communicate those metrics with senior leadership. Provide visibility and transparency into what experiments are running and what key metrics are being impacted.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\u2022 Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Physics, Statistics, Mathematics, Data Science, Econometrics, Operations Research, Computer Science, or related field AND 5+ years data-science experience (e.g., managing structured and unstructured data, applying statistical techniques and reporting results)\n\u2022 OR Master's Degree in Physics, Statistics, Mathematics, Data Science, Econometrics, Operations Research, Computer Science, or related field AND 3+ years data-science experience (e.g., managing structured and unstructured data, applying statistical techniques and reporting results)\n\u2022 OR Doctorate in Physics, Statistics, Mathematics, Data Science, Econometrics, Operations Research, Computer Science, or related field AND 2+ years data-science experience (e.g., managing structured and unstructured data, applying statistical techniques and reporting results)\n\u2022 5+ years experience with relational database and SQL skills with working knowledge of data warehousing concepts, including technical architecture, infrastructure components, ETL/ELT and reporting/analytic tools and environments such as Hadoop, Spark, Pig, Hive, or MapReduce\n\u2022 Experience with market-leading 3P experimentation platforms like Optimizely, Adobe Target, AB Tasty, Statsig etc or in-house experimentation platform are a plus\n\u2022 7+ years of experience in an analytics and/or optimization role\n\u2022 Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems, collaborating with cross-functional teams, translating high-level business requirements into technical architecture, developing and executing strategic vision\n\u2022 Strong communication and influencing skills including growing and training others.\n\nAdditional or Preferred Qualifications\n\u2022 Bachelor's Degree in Physics, Statistics, Mathematics, Data Science, Econometrics, Operations Research, Computer Science, or related field AND 7+ years data-science experience (e.g., managing structured and unstructured data, applying statistical techniques and reporting results)\n\u2022 OR Master's Degree in Physics, Statistics, Mathematics, Data Science, Econometrics, Operations Research, Computer Science, or related field AND 5+ years data-science experience (e.g., managing structured and unstructured data, applying statistical techniques and reporting results)\n\u2022 OR Doctorate in Physics, Statistics, Mathematics, Data Science, Econometrics, Operations Research, Computer Science, or related field AND 3+ years data-science experience (e.g., managing structured and unstructured data, applying statistical techniques and reporting results)\n\u2022 Previous experience of applying software development skills to economic-oriented problems, randomized controlled experiments and deploying statistical models.\n\nChewy is committed to equal opportunity.
