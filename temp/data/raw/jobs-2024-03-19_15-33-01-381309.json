Then bring your experience in software engineering to Citi and seize the opportunity to explore AI and LLMs and their real-world applications at scale to improve productivity and drive operational efficiencies.\n\nWe are seeking an innovative Full Stack Engineering Lead to join the Operations Engineering and Architecture group. This dedicated team is focused on driving Operations technology target state and delivering tangible reductions in process friction, errors, and manual effort. In this role you will be responsible for driving and contributing to the technical direction of our products and services, instilling engineering best practices into the team, and promoting cultural change across the organization. You will also work with Generative AI technologies, such as GPT-4, embedding their capabilities through prompt engineering in our systems.\n\nWe are solely focused on the most modern technology and engineering disciplines such as generative AI, cloud, security, modern app stacks (with Golang, Gatekeeper), open source and the latest in the Kubernetes ecosystem.\n\nYou will be joining us right at the beginning of our journey. We are seeking experienced software engineers who thrive in a results-driven environment, passionate about AI and LLM and who (just like us!) love programming.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do:\n\u2022 Contribute to both, engineering and research\n\u2022 Take a product-focused approach and build solutions that are robust, scalable, and easy to use\n\u2022 Work in a fast-paced environment tackling cutting-edge problems by constantly testing and learning\n\u2022 Pair programming for our products, be lean in your approach and remove bureaucracy where you see it\n\u2022 Deliver fast, iterating and pivot as you go, rather than defining the perfect solution upfront\n\u2022 Develop foundational components and mature technology capabilities in AI and LLMs\n\u2022 Drive adoption across the enterprise\n\nWhat we\u2019ll need from you:\n\u2022 Deep hands on knowledge of Kubernetes, developing backend platforms and engineering solutions that scale\n\u2022 Fluency in at least two programming language, with preference for Python, Javascript/Typescript, Golang\n\u2022 Experience designing control and sandboxing systems for AI research\n\u2022 Pytorch, TensorFlow experience\n\u2022 Experience maintaining and/or contributing to bug bounty and responsible disclosure programs\n\u2022 Understanding of language models and transformers\n\u2022 Rich understanding of vector stores and search algorithms\n\u2022 Large-scale ETL development\n\u2022 Direct engineering experience of high performance, large-scale AI/ML systems\n\u2022 Have experience supporting fast-paced startup engineering teams\n\u2022 Have used LangChain and even contributed to the project.\n\u2022 As Generative AI is a relatively new and growing space, as a result, we ask that you share with us a specific AI engineering projects on LLMs that you\u2019re proud of in your application. Ideally these projects should show off complex and clever architectures or a systematic evaluation of an LLM\u2019s behavior.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nJob Family Group:\nTechnology\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nJob Family:\nApplications Development\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nTime Type:\nFull time\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrimary Location:\nNew York New York United States\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrimary Location Salary Range:\n$142,320.00 - $213,480.00\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nCiti is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer.\n\nQualified applicants will receive consideration without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.\n\nCitigroup Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"Citi\u201d) invite all qualified interested applicants to apply for career opportunities.
