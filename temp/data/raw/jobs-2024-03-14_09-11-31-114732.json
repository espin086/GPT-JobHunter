Adapting as the waterbed wave receded, Denver Mattress began producing innerspring mattresses for the Kidz Beds\u00ae line in 1992 and shortly thereafter began producing full-line conventional adult size bedding to compliment the bedroom sets being sold through Oak Express. In April 1995, Denver Mattress opened the first Denver Mattress store in Denver, CO. and has since expanded to become one of the largest privately held mattress company in the United States with over 90 locations in 30 states.\n\nAdvancement Opportunities:\n\nDenver Mattress retail stores promote entirely from within.
