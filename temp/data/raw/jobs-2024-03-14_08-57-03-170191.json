Powered by technology and a network of over 1,800 restaurants, Fooda feeds hungry people at work through our ongoing food programs located within companies and office buildings. Every day, each Fooda location is served by different restaurants that come onsite and serve fresh lunch from their chef\u2019s unique menus. Fooda operates in twenty major US cities and plans to continue its expansion across the United States.\nWho We Are Looking For:\nAs the Director of Business Development, reporting to the Executive Vice President of Enterprise Sales, you will work independently to source and develop opportunities for Workplace Convenience Services (WCS). Within your area of focus you will create and manage your own sales pipeline from prospecting to contract close. You will be responsible for the full sales lifecycle, including prospecting, discovery, contract negotiations and solutions management. You will help support the implementation of any opportunities that you bring in, but this is primarily a hunter role with a focus on new business. The ideal candidate is a results-oriented, performance-driven individual who sets and delivers on high expectations internally and externally.\nKey Performance Indicators of this role include quarterly targets achieved through successful execution of sales leads and account penetration. These leads fill the Qualified Opportunity and Solution Evaluation stages of the sales pipeline. The average sales cycle in this role is 3-6 months.\nWhat You Will Be Doing:\n\u2022 This is a hunter role \u2013 you will run the entire sales process from prospecting to the close and contract execution. Initially, the role will also include a sales engineering component that will involve assisting the current market and caf\u00e9 sales team in closing deals that are assigned to them. This could include joint sales calls and proposals to help the existing sales team win new business with the end goal of helping the sales force be self-sufficient with the WCS product. We expect that over time the sales engineer requirements will diminish, especially given the variance in compensation structure of hunter and sales engineer in the 2024 compensation plan.\n\u2022 Manage, nurture, and grow relationships by interacting with and influencing key decision makers in the hospital space\n\u2022 Advise senior/enterprise-level customers on how to best realize the value of Fooda by strategic business alignment, innovation, and implementation \u2013 aka, find the path to close the deal!\n\u2022 Develop, write, and deliver value-based sales proposals to potential clients aligning to specific requirements and respond to inbound client RFPs\n\u2022 Explore potential partnerships with industry leaders to expand and promote the Fooda brand to close more deals\n\nWho You Are:\n\u2022 5+ years of successful direct sales experience with results in the pantry, micro-mart, and office coffee business\n\u2022 Experience in a sales or operations capacity at a food services provider\n\u2022 Must be a self-starter with the ability to generate his or her own opportunities\n\u2022 Possess excellent communication skills with a proven record in building strong sales relationships, including client presentations\n\u2022 Conduct effective outreach that gets you in front of decision makers\n\u2022 Demonstrate ability to think and act both strategically and tactically\n\u2022 Demonstrate strong technical skills aligning to client proposals and RFP responses\n\u2022 Possess strong desire for customer experience excellence\n\nWhat We\u2019ll Hook You Up With:\n\u2022 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bCompetitive market salary, annual bonus, and stock options based on experience\n\u2022 Comprehensive health, dental and vision insurance plans\n\u2022 401k retirement plan with company match\n\u2022 Paid maternity and parental leave benefits\n\u2022 Flexible spending accounts\n\u2022 Company-issued laptop\n\u2022 Daily subsidized lunch program (ours!) and free food and beverages in the office\n\u2022 A fulfilling, challenging adventure of a work experience\n\nMust be authorized to work in the United States on a full-time basis.
