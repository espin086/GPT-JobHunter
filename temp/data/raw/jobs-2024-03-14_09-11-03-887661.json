Do you want to hop aboard and revolutionize a MULTI-TRILLION dollar market, or do you want to watch from the sidelines? (Hint: There's only one right answer, so get the heck over here!)\n\nThe Opportunity (what's This All About)\n\nAs the Director of Business Development focused on fund sponsor relations, you will play a pivotal role in driving the growth of our new transfer agent business line. Your primary responsibility will be to identify and engage with sponsors of alternative asset funds, with the goal of signing them up for our transfer agent services and to list on LODAS's alternative-asset secondary market. In addition, you'll foster ongoing relationships with the sponsors to contribute to the long-term success and expansion of the business.\n\nBenefits (why We're Amazing)\n\nWonderful Paradoxes. We have a special culture that embraces being a \"wonderful paradox.\" Each of us is professionally driven, but personally laid back. Rational but kind-hearted. Smart but humble. Self-starters but highly collaborative. Strategy-minded but execution-oriented.\n\nDolla' Dolla' Billz Y'all. We have an entirely unique approach to salary that makes it ridiculously competitive, fair, and equitable. You'll absolutely plotz when you hear about it.\n\nA Little Walkin' Around Money. All employees are eligible for our discretionary bonus program, which is distinctive because it is based on us hitting certain milestones and is paid throughout the year as we hit them.\n\nRetire to Costa Rica. How do you generate REAL wealth? Equity. And every LODAS employee receives stock options when they join as well as every year of employment starting on their 2 1/2-year anniversaries.\n\nBe Responsible Like Your Parents Always Wanted. We don't have a 401(k) yet, but at some point we will, and when we do, you'll be able to save like mad and retire to Costa Rica TWICE.\n\nTry Out Costa Rica Before You Retire There. We have an unprescribed vacation policy, which means there is no set limit of vacation days, and as long as you're killing it at your job and your manager is fine with it, you can take as much vacation as you want. Guilt free!\n\nOh Canada! Currently, we cover 100% of employees' medical, dental, and vision premiums in our healthcare plan (although that policy is always subject to change given how bonkers healthcare rates can get). Want a set of gold-plated grillz? It's on us! (Well, as long as our insurance covers it, which it probably doesn't.)\n\nRequirements (why You're Amazing)\n\u2022 6+ years experience in business development and sales within the transfer agent space.\n\u2022 Dogged determination and a unique ability to come up with creative solutions and compelling messaging for overcoming objections.\n\u2022 Deep, existing relationships with sponsors of alternative-asset and real estate funds.\n\u2022 Strong understanding of the transfer agent services business and of the fund management landscape.\n\u2022 Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a dynamic, fast-paced environment (experience working at a tech startup is a bonus).\n\u2022 Need to be located in or willing to relocate to the Kansas City metro area.", "job_is_remote": false, "job_posted_at_timestamp": 1710367382, "job_posted_at_datetime_utc": "2024-03-13T22:03:02.000Z", "job_city": "Overland Park", "job_state": "KS", "job_country": "US", "job_latitude": 38.982227, "job_longitude": -94.67079, "job_benefits": ["health_insurance", "paid_time_off", "retirement_savings", "dental_coverage"], "job_google_link": "https://www.google.com/search?gl=us&hl=en&rciv=jb&q=sponsorship+sales+director&start=10&ibp=htl;jobs#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htiq=sponsorship+sales+director&htidocid=Hd6rPWhiBRlyIGVyAAAAAA%3D%3D", "job_offer_expiration_datetime_utc": "2024-04-12T22:03:01.000Z", "job_offer_expiration_timestamp": 1712959381, "job_required_experience": {"no_experience_required": false, "required_experience_in_months": 72, "experience_mentioned": true, "experience_preferred": false}, "job_required_skills": null, "job_required_education": {"postgraduate_degree": false, "professional_certification": false, "high_school": false, "associates_degree": false, "bachelors_degree": true, "degree_mentioned": false, "degree_preferred": false, "professional_certification_mentioned": false}, "job_experience_in_place_of_education": false, "job_min_salary": null, "job_max_salary": null, "job_salary_currency": null, "job_salary_period": null, "job_highlights": {"Qualifications": ["Smart but humble", "Self-starters but highly collaborative", "6+ years experience in business development and sales within the transfer agent space", "Dogged determination and a unique ability to come up with creative solutions and compelling messaging for overcoming objections", "Deep, existing relationships with sponsors of alternative-asset and real estate funds", "Strong understanding of the transfer agent services business and of the fund management landscape", "Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a dynamic, fast-paced environment (experience working at a tech startup is a bonus)", "Need to be located in or willing to relocate to the Kansas City metro area"], "Responsibilities": ["Your primary responsibility will be to identify and engage with sponsors of alternative asset funds, with the goal of signing them up for our transfer agent services and to list on LODAS's alternative-asset secondary market"], "Benefits": ["Strategy-minded but execution-oriented", "We have an entirely unique approach to salary that makes it ridiculously competitive, fair, and equitable", "All employees are eligible for our discretionary bonus program, which is distinctive because it is based on us hitting certain milestones and is paid throughout the year as we hit them", "And every LODAS employee receives stock options when they join as well as every year of employment starting on their 2 1/2-year anniversaries", "We don't have a 401(k) yet, but at some point we will, and when we do, you'll be able to save like mad and retire to Costa Rica TWICE", "Try Out Costa Rica Before You Retire There", "We have an unprescribed vacation policy, which means there is no set limit of vacation days, and as long as you're killing it at your job and your manager is fine with it, you can take as much vacation as you want", "Guilt free!"]}, "job_job_title": "Director", "job_posting_language": "en", "job_onet_soc": "11202100", "job_onet_job_zone": "4"}
