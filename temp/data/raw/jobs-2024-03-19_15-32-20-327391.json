We build category-leading software that can significantly improve battery lifespan and performance by employing advanced predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and adaptive battery management algorithms.\n\nCoulomb is headquartered in San Francisco with its development and research center in Bangalore. Founders [Khushboo Shrivastava][1] and [Santanu Mondal][2] are alumni of IIT Bombay and have first-hand experience working on first-generation Electric Vehicles at General Motors. We are backed by some of the best climate tech investors in the world, including Y Combinator, Harvard Management Seed Capital, CSVE Ventures, and prominent Silicon Valley-based Angels.\n\nWe already have a global presence with customers in 5 countries across UK, US, APAC and India\n\nAbout the Role\n\nBeing part of the founding team, you will have the opportunity to shape the future of sustainable energy. If you are a data scientist with a passion for leveraging your skills to drive positive environmental change, we encourage you to apply and be a key player in shaping the future of electric transportation.\n\nAs a Lead Data Scientist, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing\n\u2022 Lead the development of battery modeling using state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical techniques\n\u2022 Build novel predictive models on real-time data streams\n\u2022 Develop and deploy machine learning models at scale, navigating the challenges presented by large and complex datasets\n\u2022 Actively assist in building systems to continuously track model performance, ensuring models remain effective in dynamic environments\n\u2022 Communicate findings and insights to technical and non-technical stakeholders\n\u2022 Implement effective debugging tools and practices to diagnose and address performance issues or unexpected behaviors\n\u2022 Maintain up-to-date documentation on model maintenance procedures, troubleshooting guides, and best practices\n\nWe are excited about you because you have\n\u2022 4+ years of hands-on experience in data science, with a focus on Big Data Exploration, Summarization, and ML Deployment\n\u2022 Successfully delivered at least one product or pivotal feature, actively involved in business problem identification, researching, sourcing necessary data, and constructing data pipelines\n\u2022 Strong grasp of end-to-end data science practices, encompassing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, testing, and deployment using ML libraries and frameworks in Python\n\u2022 Adept at utilizing SQL for comprehensive analysis\n\nYou\u2019ll be a great fit if additionally, you have\n\u2022 Knowledge of big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) and experience with distributed computing\n\u2022 Experience deploying ML models in production, including knowledge of model deployment and optimization\n\u2022 Previously worked in a startup environment and have a high degree of ownership and appetite for ambiguity\nLike being a part of a high-performing
