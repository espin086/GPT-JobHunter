Think solar, roofing, and real estate sales reps.\n\nThey talk to customers face to face, our mobile app records their conversations, and our AI automatically transcribes and analyzes their conversations to help them improve their sales.\n\nOur vision is to bring the power of conversation intelligence from the Zoom meeting and the call center to the more than 10M sales people who work offline.\n\nWe\u2019re growing 20% MoM, have dozens of customers including Fortune 500 companies, Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone\u2019s, and we are profitable!\n\nWe\u2019re backed by Byron Deeter (one of the best investors in history) from Bessemer Venture Partners, the top Cloud investor in the world. And we\u2019re a Cloud 100 Rising Star company.\n\nWho You Are\n\u2022    An infinite learner. Someone who is always curious. You quickly learn new technologies and execute independently. You are a generalist who will deep dive into a challenge.\n\u2022    A customer obsessive. Someone who deeply cares about delighting customers and solving their pains, not about vanity metrics.\n\u2022    A quality obsessive. Someone who deeply cares about our users and the quality of their work. Our customers are not tech companies. They\u2019re people who live and work in the real world. To solve problems for them you need to have extreme empathy. You have to understand how they work, what they need, and want, and how to make their lives better.\n\u2022    A team player. You love giving and receiving feedback, and learning and growing as a team.\n\u2022    Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.\n\nThe Role\n\nYou will be a part of the founding team in one of the fastest growing startups in the world. As we scale, we need an ML engineer who can build high-quality products quickly. You will collaborate with everyone at Rillavoice, even our customers, to deliver a world-class solution.\n\nOur ML stack involves Python, PyTorch, OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, Docker, Flask, Gunicorn, PostgreSQL and Neo4J. We will look to your experience to impact our codebase and help our ML team expand its skillset.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll do\n\u2022 Build high-quality products very fast.\n\u2022 Contribute to building new features from scratch as we push forward our technical roadmap.\n\u2022 Have empathy for our users and build solutions for them. And you\u2019ll be able to do this without any explicit planning or expectations.\n\u2022 Push for a high bar for the quality of our codebase and our technical decisions. You\u2019ll help in setting the standard for the future as we scale the ML organization here at Rillavoice.\n\u2022 Scale yourself. Being an early-stage company, you will need to grow in both leadership and execution as the company scales.\n\u2022 Help recruit additional scientists/engineers to expand the team.\n\nWhat you bring\n\u2022 2+ years experience in designing/implementing solutions, ideally some of it in startups.\n\u2022 Ability to move fast and iterate quickly without sacrificing quality.\n\u2022 A customer-first mindset and an interest in talking with customers to make sure what we\u2019re building meets their needs.\n\u2022 Experience across some/most of the entire stack. Ability to quickly learn and fill in the gaps.\n\u2022 Experience owning technically challenging projects.\n\nCompensation\n\nOur compensation philosophy is that we always pay top of market - above the 90th percentile. This means that whatever you\u2019re getting paid currently, or whatever the market is willing to pay you, we\u2019ll pay you more.
