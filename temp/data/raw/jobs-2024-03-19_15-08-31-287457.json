This commitment is brought to life in the Institute for Data Science in Oncology (IDSO), a flagship program designed to reshape patient experiences and fast-track scientific breakthroughs via data-driven cancer care methodologies. The IDSO embodies a data-centric culture, pushing the envelope of modern care and venturing into uncharted territories of cancer research and treatment. It is home to a vibrant team of data scientists committed to unraveling complex cancer challenges, reducing time between diagnosis and treatment decisions, and accelerating drug discovery.\n\nMDACC is recruiting Data Scientists for its newly established Computational Pathology program. This program aims to distil meaningful insights from the extensive resources and data available at MD Anderson, particularly from cancer pathology that is currently benefiting from a digital revolution. Automated, unbiased sample selection and scalable study design will immediately facilitate deep spatial investigations in landmark MD Anderson programs, including APOLLO and Patient MOSAIC, to direct novel data analysis, enable translational studies, and generate clinical impact.\n\nMDACC provides the ideal environment for developing, testing, and deploying AI technologies for improved early cancer diagnosis and accurate treatment selection. The Computational Pathology program is a key focus area of the IDSO and supports the IDSO's mission to drive high-impact discovery research by optimizing multidimensional data integration, analysis, and application.\n\nWe seek a senior level data scientist to manage the daily operations and design and development of the computational methodologies, techniques, etc. for advanced research and development in numerical analysis, mathematical modeling and data processing techniques for this program. They will lead a team of data scientists to develop cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing methods for digital pathology, and to conduct clinical evaluation studies for implementation of these AI tools in the pathology clinical work flow.\n\nWork Schedule and location: Monday - Friday / 8am - 5pm / Onsite 2- 3 days - based on business needs.
