Through our patented retail data model and the recent release of Bluecore Communicate\u2122 and Bluecore Site\u2122, we replace manual processes with an intelligent, AI-driven workflow. We are credited with doubling email revenue, and increasing customer retention for more than 400 brands, including Express, Tommy Hilfiger, The North Face, Teleflora, and Bass Pro Shops. We have been recognized as one of the Best Places to Work by Glassdoor and ranked No. 241 on the Inc. 500 List, the most prestigious ranking of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing private companies.\n\nWe are looking for Principal Data Scientists with a strong mathematical background to work alongside our Engineering Teams to build the next generation of retail and commerce models that delight and empower marketers. The ideal candidate is one that has several years of experience researching, building, serving, and maintaining data science models at scale. They are able to work with our Product Team to translate product requirements into the correct objectives, perform literature searches to identify the right approach, design thoughtful experiments, and write production code to serve the model and maintain it. They have first-hand experience with what works and what doesn\u2019t, and are eager to share this experience with both junior and senior members and guide them through that process. They are also able to, and excited to, help architect the data science infrastructure needed to accelerate innovation on models and facilitate serving and maintaining them. Finally, they should be curious and eager to identify and explore the myriad of other products that can be built on our unique data asset. Our culture emphasizes making good tradeoffs, working as a team, and leaving your ego at the door.\n\nOver the past six years Bluecore has shown that Marketing Teams can create meaningful and valuable experiences for their customers using only first party data; an increasingly important proposition with the rise in concerns around online privacy and third party data. As a Principal Data Scientist, you'll be joining a dedicated group of Data Scientists and Engineers at the forefront of exploring exciting ways to activate that data asset. We build powerful models that enable Marketers to make the right decisions and engage their customers with personalized content that is timely, relevant, and valuable. Our approach to building models is an academic one, starting with a literature search, a baseline, and an iterative process of training and validation to identify the most suitable model that is as simple as possible and as powerful as necessary. We employ a wide variety of models, such as Bayesian models for predicting customer lifetime value, matrix factorization to identify a customer\u2019s product affinity, and reinforcement learning models to optimize content, timing, and frequency of marketing communications.\n\nOur models operate at scale and crunch through millions of data points to make decisions that have been shown to double revenue and triple reach, and are designed in a flexible manner to generalize across our set of 400+ diverse customers who span industries from apparel to automotive. To explore, build, deploy, and maintain models we leverage many tools such as BigQuery, Spark, Cloud SQL, Keras, TensorFlow, Airflow, Kubernetes, and Google Compute Engine. Finally, we\u2019re a team that values applied research and constantly exploring the frontier of what\u2019s possible; diving into fields such as topic modeling, restricted Boltzmann machines, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks for image feature extraction, and differential privacy.\n\nResponsibilities\n\u2022 Identifying appropriate models/algorithms to solve product requirements\n\u2022 Meticulous experimentation to evaluate and compare models\n\u2022 Writing internal and external facing documentation describing models and approaches, such as wiki pages, white papers, blog posts or journal papers.\n\u2022 Deploying models to production and maintaining them\n\u2022 Evangelizing Bluecore Data Science internally and externally\n\u2022 Identifying new opportunities to leverage our data asset\n\u2022 Proposing and drive technical initiatives\n\u2022 Proposing infrastructure to accelerate the pace of model exploration and improve model serving and maintenance\n\u2022 Being a technical mentor for senior and junior team members\n\u2022 Meeting with customers to discuss our machine learning models and roadmap\n\nQualifications\n\u2022 PhD or MS in a quantitative discipline such as Applied Math, Data Science, Physics, Statistics, or Engineering\n\u2022 Deep understanding of Statistical/Probabilistic Analysis and Linear Algebra\n\u2022 8+ years of relevant industry experience, including internships\n\u2022 Experience building, delivering and maintaining Machine Learning and AI products\n\u2022 Experience setting ML/AI project roadmaps\n\u2022 Strong oral and written presentation skills\n\u2022 Experience in technical mentorship and leadership\n\u2022 Ability to write production-ready code\n\u2022 Experience with Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Time Series Analysis, and/or Optimization\n\u2022 Experience with ML at scale\n\u2022 Experience with SQL\n\nBenefits:\nHighly competitive compensation package including salary and equity as well as the opportunity to work for one of the fastest growing marketing technology companies.\n- Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance\n- 401(k) plan\n- Monthly discretionary reimbursement towards fitness, home office and/or Learning and Development opportunities\n- Generous Parental Leave & flexible vacation policy\n\nWe are proud of the culture of flexibility, inclusivity and trust that we have built around our workforce.
