The incumbent technologies that cater to these customers are decades old, and drivers, fleets, and the merchants that serve them all increasingly demand modern digital experiences and affordable and transparent financial services products. Coast's mission is to deliver them at a transformational scale, and to improve working lives in one of the country\u2019s biggest industry sectors. The company is backed by top fintech and mobility venture funds.\n\nCoast is competing and winning with software, and we are building a world-class engineering team. This is a unique opportunity to get in on the ground level early on, contribute and learn in myriad ways, make key decisions, expand your impact as the business grows, have fun, and learn a ton in the process. If you're practical and business-minded, smart and creative, and excited about the rewards and the energy of an early-stage venture-backed startup, we'd love to hear from you.\n\nWe are looking for a founding member of the Coast data engineering team to shape our company\u2019s data culture and underlying infrastructure.\n\nWe have followed the path of least resistance so far, creating a data warehouse and pulling in both operational and vendor data, adding BI and other SaaS tools on top of it.\n\nNow as we are growing, we recognize the need for a dedicated leader for all things data at Coast \u2014 someone that can work with our business users, establish company-wide self-serve data infrastructure, and enable product engineering teams to build data products well. We are looking for someone that can champion data-aware culture within the company, as well as roll up their sleeves and build out the technical pieces behind it. Looking ahead, we need to position ourselves well for feature engineering work that will power our AI/ML use cases. This means metadata, automation, observability, and quality.\n\nWe need you to help us establish a vision for the data ecosystem evolution while satisfying day to day demands of a rapidly growing early stage startup.\n\nYou will report directly to the Head of Engineering and work from our NYC office.\n\nThe Data Engineer will:\n\u2022 lead design and implementation of all aspects of our data ecosystem \u2014 from obtaining third party data to building our own data products, from infrastructure architecture to end-user BI and data exploration toolchain;\n\u2022 evangelize and implement the best practices, from reasoning about statistical significance to implementing headless BI, from source control and change management to database migrations;\n\u2022 establish guardrails for self-serve ecosystem for the business users;\n\u2022 help our product engineering teams evolve from treating data as exhaust to building DDD-based data products;\n\u2022 establish ETL/ELT patterns, from landing zone to semantic layers;\n\u2022 ensure that our metrics are built on top of consistent, curated data with clear stewardship;\n\u2022 oversee our connected SaaS data landscape;\n\u2022 own the budget for the data infrastructure and develop a sensible cost allocation model;\n\u2022 safeguard our data, from tokenization and access controls, to retention and backups;\n\u2022 remain relentlessly pragmatic and balance the daily demands or a fast-growing startup business with the needs of a well-managed platform;\n\u2022 eventually hire and run a data org as we scale.\n\nThe Data Engineer must:\n\u2022 have 7-10+ years hands-on experience working across the data ecosystem, from modern ETL/ELT and orchestration to data warehouses and columnar stores, from BI tooling for less-technical business users to SQL optimization;\n\u2022 have software engineering mindset, leading with the principles of source control, infrastructure as code, testing, modularity, automation, CICD, and observability;\n\u2022 bring in a strong professional network, since it is impossible to know everything, and one must be able to tap others for advice;\n\u2022 have experience working directly with product engineers as well as business users;\n\u2022 be proficient in Python, since you would be expected to contribute data platform aspects into product engineering code as well as write your own tools;\n\u2022 be able to figure stuff out - the modern data space is deep and complex, and there are many ways of solving the same problem; you need to be able to go off on your own, research and design a solution, implement technical spikes, and then deliver it through responsible change management;\n\u2022 have an owner mindset and continuously look for, notice, and implement improvements to our data infrastructure, because small continuous improvements matter;\n\u2022 be a thought-leader that keeps a finger on the pulse of the industry - vendor landscape, industry trends;\n\u2022 work from our NYC SoHo office at least four days a week.\n\nCompensation:\n\nOur salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size and industry, and are one part of our total compensation package that also includes benefits, signing bonus, and equity.
