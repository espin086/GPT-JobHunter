Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things \u2014 through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their own, they don\u2019t actually do a whole lot, they\u2019re kind of just there. They don\u2019t help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more \u2014 it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building one: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.\n\nTo accomplish this lofty task, we\u2019re building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences. This isn\u2019t optional, it\u2019s crucial to our mission, as we need a wide range of perspectives to challenge our assumptions and shape our browser through a bold, creative lens.\n\nWith that in mind, we especially encourage women, people of color, and others from historically marginalized groups to apply.\nAbout The Role\n\nBrowsers know everything about us and what we do everyday, and yet they can\u2019t predict our next move, morph themselves to better suit our tasks, or proactively take work off our plate. As the first Machine Learning Engineer at The Browser Company, you will work with product engineers to prototype and explore how we can build a smarter, more personalized web browser with a focus on privacy-preserving, on-device models.\n\nYou\u2019ll work to answers questions like \u2013\n\u2022 What kind of features are better suited for on-device models vs modern LLM APIs like GPT?\n\u2022 How can we get on-device inference quality to match that of GPT 3.5 or 4?\n\u2022 How can we get local LLM and embedding models to run faster and more performantly on our members\u2019 machines?\n\u2022 Can we distill larger models into a smaller footprint? Or fine-tune local models to work well for our particular use-cases?\n\u2022 Can we fine-tune performant neural networks to do narrow tasks where the generalizability of LLMs are not necessary?\n\u2022 How do we collect or build synthetic datasets for our models in a privacy-safe way so we can continue to be one of the most privacy-sensitive browsers on the market\n\nOverall you will...\n\u2022 Scope and spearhead projects to fine-tune, distill, or train models for various features within Arc\n\u2022 Push the boundaries of what on-device and privacy-safe AI and ML can be used for\n\u2022 Work with Product Engineers, Product Designers, and Design Engineers to understand how we can use heuristics, neural networks, and LLMs to create magical experiences within Arc\n\u2022 Build infrastructure to collect or generate training data for building or improving models\n\u2022 Build ways for us to determine and track model performance and accuracy, and improve performance and accuracy over time\n\nAfter 1 month you will...\n\u2022 Onboard to the team and codebase with your onboarding buddy\n\u2022 Attend a number of onboarding presentations on the company, product, codebase, and culture\n\u2022 Get familiar with the Swift language, the Arc codebase, and how we ship features\n\u2022 Discuss and start formulating our ML roadmap with our CTO\n\u2022 Ship a few bug fixes and small improvements across our codebase and tooling\n\u2022 Have pair programmed with a few people on the engineering team\n\u2022 Be regularly posting product feedback about the browser in our #dogfooding channel\n\nAfter 3 months you will...\n\u2022 Be familiar with how we prototype and build new features, working with product engineers to brainstorm ways to use models to add intelligence to Arc\n\u2022 Be familiar with our infrastructure and data pipelines\n\u2022 Ship a few prototypes with existing, on-device models to test performance and viability\n\u2022 Participate in product brainstorms to think about the future of Arc\n\u2022 Regularly attend weekly engineering discussions about our architecture, how we do code review, code style, and more\n\nAfter 6 months you will...\n\u2022 Creatively solve problems with product engineers, using pragmatic solutions ranging from basic heuristics, regressions, ML models, to AI depending on the feature\n\u2022 Drive projects from conception to production launch independently\n\u2022 Own our infrastructure to collect training data and fine-tune models for our use-cases\n\u2022 Have built out mechanisms to assess quality and performance, and be working with product teams to improve the efficacy of our models and heuristics\n\u2022 Be interview trained and interviewing candidates for roles at the Browser Company\n\u2022 Be mentoring and pair-programming with newer engineers to help them get spun up on the codebase\n\nQualifications\n\u2022 You have experience developing machine learning models, especially ones that can run under tight power and performance constraints, in a real-world product environment\n\u2022 You have experience with fine-tuning, distilling, and improving existing ML models\n\u2022 You're passionate about prototyping product features and using pragmatic solutions to solve problems, biasing for fast feedback loops\n\u2022 You\u2019re experienced with Python and modern ML libraries\n\u2022 You have experience as a technical lead on critical projects or initiatives within your team and organization\n\u2022 You're pragmatic and can see the bigger picture. You're able to reason about prioritization and scope\n\u2022 You have a bias for action. We like learning as quickly as possible, so we embrace failing fast to refine our code, systems, and processes rapidly\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nWith our flexible compensation model, employees have the ability to design their compensation according to their needs. People join startups for different reasons and we want to be accommodating and flexible to everyone\u2019s lives. Every candidate approved for an offer receives two options:\n\n\u2709\ufe0f The first offer is a lower salary with a higher equity package\n\n\u2709\ufe0f The second is a higher salary with a lower equity package.\n\nCandidates can choose either option or anywhere in between the two on a sliding scale. The annual salary range for this role is $150,000-300,000, and the actual salary range offered will vary based on experience level and interview performance.\n\n    \u200d\u2640\ufe0f In addition to a competitive salary and equity package, we provide every employee with the following benefits:\n\u2022 comprehensive benefits package, with employee medical, dental, and vision premiums covered at 100%\n\u2022 401k plan\n\u2022 flexible vacation policy: on average, our team members take between 15-20 vacation days plus federal holidays (holidays vary by location)\n\u2022 12 weeks of paid parental leave\n\u2022 $1,500 USD home office stipend\n\u2022 Employees based in the US also receive free annual memberships to One Medical, Talkspace, Teladoc, and HealthAdvocate\n\nThe Browser Company is a well-funded, ambitious startup of about 70 people (and growing!) who are passionate about building great products. We are a remote-first, distributed team, with the option to work in office in New York. We strongly support diversity and encourage people from all backgrounds to apply.\n\n   To read more about what we value as a company, check out Notes on Roadtrips on our blog.", "job_is_remote":
