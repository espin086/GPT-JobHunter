Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford, Dartmouth, Harvard, Mass. General), technologists (athenahealth, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Flatiron, WalMart Health), healthcare innovators (Oscar, Aledade, VillageMD, Stellar, Arcadia) and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna, Humana, Cigna, United) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States\u2019 future health. Pearl recently announced a strategic partnership to proliferate value-based care with Walgreens, one of the largest healthcare companies in the country. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.\n\nPearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time, this solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk more available and more readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare, and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.\n\nWhat we hope you can do...\n\nWe are seeking a sales-oriented Data Scientist \u2014 think Sales Engineer, but for Data Science \u2014 with a track record of managing cross-functional projects and communicating quantitative results to a lay audience. You will function as a bridge between our Data Science and Growth teams, giving a voice to analyses that can delve into the arcane and helping close sales by articulating the value of Pearl\u2019s offering. You should be an effective and compelling communicator and a strategic thinker with a penchant for understanding the needs of internal and external clients. The role will leverage and extend our analytic platform to predict financial outcomes for healthcare entities, aligning those research projects with an evolving and highly seasonal go-to-market motion, metabolizing third party analyses in order to compare them to internally-generated reports, and providing feedback to your colleagues about how we can further differentiate and elevate Pearl\u2019s offerings.\n\nWhat a Senior Data Scientist, Sales means to us during the sales season...\n\u2022 Engage with salespeople and sales leads as a \u201chuman explicability layer.\u201d Although you might have direct contact with leads during our inside sales motion, automating explicability through technical processes would certainly be within the scope of the job.\n\u2022 Manage a complex and dynamic collaboration between the Data Science and Growth teams, which will require requisitioning and organizing resources in order to ensure that SLAs are met or exceeded throughout the sales motion.\n\u2022 Help us refine our product-market fit by providing strategic guidance as to what aspects of the sales offerings are compelling and which aren\u2019t working.\n\u2022 Ensure quality and availability of various data sources: lead information, sales touchpoint info, evolution of financial analyses shared with a lead, and deal terms.\n\nWhat a Senior Data Scientist, Sales means to us during the off-cycle\u2026\n\u2022 Research payment models that resonate with providers and power our go-to-market motion.\n\u2022 Enable the support of the growth motion through design and implementation of technical systems.\n\u2022 Deepen knowledge of the healthcare models and programs in which Pearl is operating (e.g. ACO REACH, MSSP, Medicare Advantage).\n\u2022 Evaluate vendors to help us better understand our customers and the market.\n\nWho you are\u2026\n\u2022 8+ years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a healthcare management or professional consulting environment, although strong candidates with less experience will certainly be considered.\n\u2022 A degree in statistics, applied math, computer science, engineering or a related field (e.g., healthcare policy) is strongly preferred.\n\u2022 SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages (Python, R, Julia, Scala, Matlab). Python is our current primary language and is preferred.\n\u2022 A thoughtful collaborator who is able to design and execute quantitatively-driven business processes in a way that balances deep insight and fast turnaround.\n\u2022 Eloquent communicator of quantitative analyses, in particular those relating to financial estimates or healthcare, to a lay audience.\n\u2022 A proven ability to apply research and analytic models to inform growth operations including product-market fit, the development of sales collateral, and the evolution of RevOps (\u201cGrowthOps\u201d in Pearl-speak) workflows.\n\u2022 Relish synthesizing the complexity of the healthcare/financial ecosystem into actionable insights that provide value to providers.\n\nOur Values\n\nWe are an Equal Opportunity Employer and our employees are people with different strengths, experiences and backgrounds, who share a passion for improving people's lives. Our definition of diversity not only includes race and gender identity, but also age, disability status, veteran status, sexual orientation, religion and many other parts of one\u2019s identity. We believe all of our colleague\u2019s points of view are integral to our success, and that inclusion is everyone's responsibility and a cause of beautiful things.\n\nWe welcome candidates from all backgrounds and are committed to a fair hiring process free from discrimination and focused around problem solving, improvement, and mutual empowerment.\n\nRemote Work\n\nWe are a remote-first company, with a concentration of team members at our NYC headquarters and in the Boston area.\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\nThe salary range Pearl Health expects to pay for this position is between $130,000-$170,000 per year.
