Machine Learning (AI / ML) capabilities are critical accelerators to our mission to delivering towards inventing new medicines that save and improve lives.\n\nCore to the Data, AI and Genome Sciences (DAGS) function is an AI / ML-first approach to improving target and biomarker discovery, validation and selection and elucidating complex disease mechanisms.\n\nAs Director of Data Science, Foundation Model Lead you will build state-of-the art AI / ML capabilities for analyzing genomic, multi-omic, imaging, single cell, and deep phenotypic and clinical data / model systems to derive clinically relevant insights for disease biology and target discovery.\n\nYou will be part of a cross-functional team of computational biologists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, software engineers, and machine learning engineers that strive to identify therapeutic targets.\n\nYou will report to the Executive Director, Head of AI / ML\n\nPrimary Responsibilities :\n\nLead technically the development and implementation of pre-trained transformer-based foundation and cutting-edge machine learning models for target discovery, leveraging large-scale biological and imaging data.\n\nCollaborate closely with cross-functional teams, including data scientists, biologists, and software engineers to develop and deliver scalable machine learning solutions.\n\nIntegrate diverse datasets, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to extract clinically relevant insight and uncover disease biology and novel drug targets.\n\nKnow the latest research and identify opportunities to leverage new advancements in ML for target and biomarker discovery.\n\nContribute to publications and present results at internal and external scientific conferences and workshops.\n\nRequired Experience and Skills :\n\nPhD in machine learning, computer science, physics, or related field and 8+ years\u2019 experience with data science, developing and prototyping large-scale machine learning models, such as deep learning, CNN, GNN, and transformer-based foundation models OR MS and 10+ years of experience OR BS and 14+ years of experience.\n\nDemonstrated hands-on experience in developing, training, and transfer learning of large-scale transformer-based foundation models.\n\nGood understanding of the underlying algorithmic approaches of traditional and modern machine learning approaches.\n\nStrong programming skills, particularly in languages such as Python, and proficiency in relevant machine learning libraries (PyTorch)\n\nExcellent communication skills, self-motivation, and ability to work collaboratively in multi-disciplinary team.\n\nPreferred experience :\n\nRelevant publications in scientific journals and experience contributing to research communities, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc preferred.\n\nThis is a hybrid position, with an expectation of 3 days / week onsite.\n\nNOTICE FOR INTERNAL
