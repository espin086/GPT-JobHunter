Our suite of Energy Internet applications allows utilities, electricity retailers, renewable energy project developers and energy service providers to deliver clean, affordable and reliable energy in a distributed energy world.\n\nHow do we do this? By pioneering the science of flexibility management. This innovative approach enables energy providers to mine the Energy Internet's rich data lode to extract flexible capacity from distributed energy resources. In turn, flexible capacity can be used to balance energy supply and demand in real time, increase the productivity and value of energy assets, and deliver new energy services to customers\n\nEstablished at Stanford University in 2011, we have assembled a team of world-class software architects, electrical and computer engineers, data scientists and energy experts who apply cutting-edge analytics and in-depth energy data science to solve the world's most critical energy problems.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nAs Senior Data Scientist, you would be working with a team of other data scientists on the core optimization capabilities of the company in an agile environment. Experience in energy / utility or related markets is desirable but not necessary. Experience in building mission critical, highly scalable optimization applications is a must. Candidate should have a deep understanding of various optimization algorithms as well as practical experience of working with open-source and commercial solvers.\n\nResponsibilities\n\u2022 Develop and maintain the optimization models and software implementation that drives AutoGrid's predictive controls platform for managing distributed energy resources\n\u2022 Benchmark and debug critical issues with the algorithms and software as they arise\n\u2022 Contribute to improving scalability and reliability of the system\n\u2022 Work with product owners to develop new features and capabilities\n\nAbout You\n\u2022 B.S., MS., or Ph.D. in computer science, operations research, industrial engineering, or related field\n\u2022 Experienced with solving large optimization problems using linear / non-linear / integer / dynamic / stochastic programming, as well as heuristic approaches\n\u2022 Deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, performance optimization techniques, relational databases, and software development in a team environment\n\u2022 Excellent programming skills in Python, Java or C++\n\u2022 Experience with optimization modeling languages (e.g. Pyomo, GAMS) and solvers (e.g. CBC, Cplex, Gurobi)\n\nNice to Have\n\u2022 Experienced with decomposition approaches to solving large-scale optimization problems\n\u2022 Hands-on experience with time series forecasting\n\u2022 Understanding of energy and capacity markets\n\u2022 Experience with frameworks such as Redis, Kafka, Celery, Hadoop/Spark\n\u2022 Start-up experience, entrepreneurial spirit, energetic\n\nBenefits and Perks\n\u2022 Working with a smart, collaborative, and fun group of people solving big important problems\n\u2022 An exciting atmosphere, and an outstanding work/life balance\n\u2022 Beautiful, spacious, modern office in Redwood Shores\n\u2022 Flexible hours and choice of computer (Mac, Ubuntu, Windows)\n\u2022 Competitive salary and equity\n\u2022 Competitive health care, dental, and vision coverage\n\u2022 Excellent 401(k) and flexible spending plans\n\u2022 Three weeks of paid time off annually, in addition to 10 paid public holidays\n\u2022 Life, short term and long-term disability, supplemental, and AD&D insurance\n\u2022 Commuter transit, parking, biking, vanpool and park & ride benefits\n\nAutoGrid is an equal opportunity employer.
