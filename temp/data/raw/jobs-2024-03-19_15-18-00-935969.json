The DataViz team collaborates with a variety of partners within Apple to distill data into actionable and intuitive visualizations that drive informed decisions.\n\nWe work cooperatively to understand challenging problems that arise during all stages of product design at Apple. The job requires collaborative work, fluency using statistics and visualizations to answer specific questions about datasets, proficient programming skills in R or Python, and most importantly, a passion for creating informative visualizations and presentations to communicate results to all levels of the company.\n\nWe encourage anyone who approaches problem solving with curiosity and imagination to apply. We value people with a desire to learn new skills and a mindset that views challenging questions as opportunities for insight.\n\nThe DataViz team enables data-driven decision making by performing analysis, modeling, and visualization of unstructured data for engineering and research design teams. Our unique position within the organization allows us to assist other teams on a wide range of products designed at Apple. Our work impacts products used by millions of people worldwide.\n\nKey Qualifications\n\nKey Qualifications\n\u2022 Preferred Qualifications:\n\u2022 No single candidate will come in with all desired qualifications \u2014 above all else we\u2019re looking for someone with an eagerness and ability to learn new skills and solve dynamic problems in a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive environment.\n\u2022 Experience programming in R or Python. You have experience using these tools to import, clean, analyze and visualize data to enable data-driven decision making.\n\u2022 Experience using statistics to identify trends and anomalies in multivariate and/or medium-sized datasets using conventional statistical techniques. Our datasets are typically not large enough to employ deep learning techniques.\n\u2022 Experience writing code to generate visualizations that enable deeper insight into data.\n\u2022 Strong interest in peer collaboration and teamwork and a willingness to solicit input and accept feedback.\n\u2022 An appreciation of functional design or interested in developing your design aesthetic.\n\u2022 Excitement and passion to communicate important information in an easily understandable manner.\n\u2022 Worth Mentioning:\n\u2022 The varied nature of the problems our team handles means that there is a lot of room for your other skills to also be of use.
