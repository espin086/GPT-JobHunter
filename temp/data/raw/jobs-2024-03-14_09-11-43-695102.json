The Spotlight Initiative (SI) is a global whole of United Nations effort to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by 2030. Launched in 2017, the Initiative invests in gender equality and women\u2019s rights as a precondition and driver for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Initiative follows a human rights-based approach and takes into consideration the specific needs of women and girls who experience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, upholding the principle of \u201cleaving no one behind\u201d.\n\nSpotlight Initiative has deployed targeted, large-scale investments to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in 25+ programmes that to date have spanned Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific. Under the stewardship of the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Spotlight Initiative recipient agencies include UN Women, UNFPA, UNDP, UNICEF, UNODC, IOM, UNHCR, WHO, UNESCO, ILO, and OHCHR.\n\nThe Initiative is supported by a Secretariat to ensure coherence, alignment, quality, and strong technical support. Six years into implementation, Spotlight Initiative 2.0 is seeking to expand the number of donors supporting Spotlight Initiative and its agency and civil society partners, while leveraging additional financing in support of the wider EVAWG and Sustainable Development agenda.

The creation of UN Women came about as part of the UN reform agenda, bringing together resources and mandates for greater impact. It merges and builds on the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN system (DAW, OSAGI, INSTRAW and UNIFEM), which focused exclusively on gender equality and women's empowerment.\n\nDiversity and inclusion:\n\nAt UN Women, we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment of mutual respect. UN Women recruits, employs, trains, compensates, and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ability, national origin, or any other basis covered by appropriate law. All employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, competence, integrity and organizational need.\n\nIf you need any reasonable accommodation to support your participation in the recruitment and selection process, please include this information in your application.\n\nUN Women has a zero-tolerance policy on conduct that is incompatible with the aims and objectives of the United Nations and UN Women, including sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual harassment, abuse of authority and discrimination. All selected candidates will be expected to adhere to UN Women\u2019s policies and procedures and the standards of conduct expected of UN Women personnel and will therefore undergo rigorous reference and background checks.
