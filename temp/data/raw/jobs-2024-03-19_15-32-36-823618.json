Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades \u2014 because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.\n\nPhaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:\n\u2022 We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.\n\u2022 We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs \u2014 perfect for reinforcement learning.\n\u2022 We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.\n\nOur team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.\n\nPhaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and India.\n\u2022 *Please only apply to one opening.
